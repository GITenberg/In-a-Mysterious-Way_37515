<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h3">INTRODUCING MRS. RAY</p>

<p>"'He moves in a mysterious way His wonders to
perform,'" sang Mrs. Ray, coming in from
the wood-shed and proceeding to fill up the stove,
with the energy which characterized her whole person.
A short, well-knit, active person it was, too,&mdash;a figure
of health and compact muscular strength, a well-shaped
head with a tight wad of neat hair on top,
bright eyes, and a firm mouth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley, a near neighbor, sat by the table and
watched her friend with the after-nightfall passivity
of a woman who has to be very active during daylight.
Mrs. Wiley was not small and well-knit, neither was
she energetic. Life for Mrs. Wiley had gone mainly
in a minor key composed largely of sharps, and as a
consequence she sighed frequently and sighed even now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray slammed the stove door and caroled louder
than ever, as if to drown even the echo of a sigh in her
kitchen. "'He moves in a mysterious way His wonders
to perform,'" she sang, and then, folding her arms on
top of her bosom in a manner peculiarly her own, she<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
spoke to Mrs. Wiley in that obtrusively cheerful tone
which we use to those who sigh when feeling no desire
to sigh with them: "That's my motto&mdash;that song&mdash;yes,
indeed. It fits everything and accounts for everything
and comes in handy anywhere any time, even if
I never have wondered myself, but have been dead
sure all along. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley sighed again, and her eyes moved towards
a large, awkward parcel rolled in newspaper, which
lay on the end of the table by her. "I'm so glad you
feel able to undertake it, Mrs. Ray. I don't know how
I ever could have managed it, if you'd said no. Mr.
Wiley <i>will</i> have a new pig-pen this year, and the pigs
never can pay for it themselves. So you were my only
way to a new winter coat. I'm so glad you didn't
say no. Besides it's father's suit, and I shall love
to wear it for that reason, too."</p>

<p>"I never do say no to any kind of work, do I?"
said Mrs. Ray, looking at the clock, and then all over
the room; "this would be a nice time of life for me to
begin to sit around and say no to work. What with
Mr. Ray's second wife's children not all educated yet,
and his first wife's children getting along to where
they're beginning to be left widows with six apiece
and no life insurance, I'm likely to want all the work
I can get for some years, as far as I can see. Yes,
indeed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wiley thinks we'd ought to insure our lives
in favor of Lottie Ann," she said, feeling for her pocket-handkerchief
at the thought; "she's so dreadful
delicate&mdash;but I think it's foolish&mdash;she's so <i>dreadful</i>
delicate."<span class="pagenum">[3]</span></p>

<p>"Why don't you insure Lottie Ann, then?" Mrs.
Ray glanced at the clock again, frowned a little and
puckered her lips. "If you don't mind taking that
chair the cat's in, Mrs. Wiley, I believe I've got just
about time enough to sprinkle the clothes before the
mail comes in; it looks so to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley slowly and gravely exchanged seats with
the cat. "Do you take much washing in now? I
shouldn't think you had time."</p>

<p>"Time!" Mrs. Ray was dragging a clothes-basket
from under the table and filling a dipper with water.
"I never stop to think whether I have time or not, any
more. 'He moves in a mysterious way&mdash;' there's
where my motto comes in again. Yes, indeed. I
move just the same way myself. I don't see how I
get so much done, but I've no time to stop and study
over it, or I'd be behind just that much. There's more
than you wonder where I get time from, Mrs. Wiley.
They asked me if I had time for the post-office. And I
said I had. They asked first if I could read and write,
and I said I could; and then they asked me if I had time,
and I said I had. And that settled it."</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Ray," said Mrs. Wiley, watching the
clothes-sprinkling, which was now going forward,
attentively, "that's one of the waists from that girl
at Nellie O'Neil's, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. She asked Nellie for a French
laundress, and Nellie put her shawl right over her head
and run up and asked me if I had time for that, too. I
said I was willing to try, so I'm a French laundress
too, now. 'He moves'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you think of those two young people at
Nellie's, anyway?" Mrs. Wiley dropped her voice<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
confidentially. "I was meaning to ask you that, right
at first."</p>

<p>"Well, if you ask <i>me</i>," said Mrs. Ray, "I can't
make him out, and I think she's mooney. I'm a great
judge of mooney people ever since I first knew Mr.
Ray, and that girl looks very mooney to me. Look
at her coming here and hiking right over and buying
the Whittacker house next day&mdash;a house I wouldn't
send a rat to buy&mdash;not if I had a real liking for the
rat. And now the way she's pulling it to pieces and
nailing on new improvements, with the trees all boxed
up, as though trees weren't free as air&mdash;oh, she's
mooney, very mooney&mdash;yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Nellie don't think they act loving," said Mrs.
Wiley; "and Joey Beall says they don't act loving even
when they're alone together. He's been building a
culvert for Mr. Ledge, and he's seen 'em alone together
twice. Joey knows how people ought to act when
they're alone together. He always knows when folks
are in love, before they know themselves. He tells
by seeing them alone together. Why, he knew when
you was going to be married&mdash;he saw you and Mr.
Ray alone together that day you walked to the Lower
Falls."</p>

<p>"But it wasn't through our acting loving that he knew
it," said Mrs. Ray, energetically ruminative between
the dipper of water and the clothes to be sprinkled;
"my, but I was mad that day! It was the first and
last time anybody ever fooled <i>me</i> into walking to the
Lower Falls. Yes, indeed. I like to of died! If Mr.
Ray hadn't asked me to marry him, I'd never have
forgiven him getting me to go on that walk. Those
flights of steps! And those paths! All the way down<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
I was wanting to turn round and go back. I made up
my mind never to take Mr. Ray's word for nothing
again. And I never did. He fooled me into that walk,
but he never fooled me again. Yes, indeed. Never!"</p>

<p>"But Joey Beall saw you that day," said Mrs. Wiley,
whose mind was of that strength which is not to be
swept beyond its gait by any other mind's rapidity,
"and he said right off that night you'd marry
him."</p>

<p>"Maybe he saw Mr. Ray take his first and second
wife down to the Lower Falls, and knew it from his
looks with them&mdash;Mr. Ray took 'em both down there,
and asked 'em each to marry him coming back. All
the way down he was telling me what they each said to
everything they saw. And coming back he showed me
where he asked 'em each. Mr. Ray never made any
secret of his first and second wife to me. I'll say that
for him. Yes, indeed. And like enough Joey was
around then. He's always round when people are alone
together."</p>

<p>"But he doesn't think these young people act loving,"
Mrs. Wiley went on, recurring to the main issue under
discussion. "Joey says they don't have the right way
at all. He says they don't disagree right, either.
They're on opposite sides of the dam, the same as if
they were married folks, but they don't seem to feel
interested in their discussing. Nellie says they're real
pleasant, but she can't understand them; Nellie's
very far from making them out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nellie can't make nothing out. She and Jack
is dead easy. Look at those other boarders they've
got. She says she can't make them out, either. I
should think not."<span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley's standpoint refused to stretch to the
other boarders. She sighed again.</p>

<p>"She seems a very nice girl," she said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, nice enough&mdash;but mooney," said Mrs.
Ray. "I know the kind as soon as I see 'em. I could
almost tell 'em by their legs, when they get down from
the train on the side away from me. She's got ideas
about souls and scenery, that girl has; but that young
man's got his living to earn, and he hasn't no time for
any ideas. I like him! We both work for the United
States Government, and that's a great bond. Yes,
indeed. That young man knows if the dam goes
through here, he'll be fixed for life digging it, and the
girl's just the kind he wants, for he's practical and she's
mooney&mdash;she's so mooney she's bought a house to
live in while he digs the dam, and yet she's solemnly
hoping there won't be no dam. She says so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she don't mean it," suggested Mrs.
Wiley.</p>

<p>"Yes, she does mean it," said Mrs. Ray; "yes,
indeed, she means it. I'm a great judge of character
and that girl means what she says."</p>

<p>"About the dam?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about everything. She's very friendly with
me. She buys lots of stamps, and cancels up like a
lady. I'm very fond of her."</p>

<p>"What did she say about the dam?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of things. She said it was a desecration
for one thing, and then I was singing one day and she
said I was very right, for the Lord did move in a very
mysterious way, and He would save the falls."</p>

<p>"Was she as sure as that?" asked Mrs. Wiley,
appalled.<span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>"She seemed to be. Oh, but she's very mooney."</p>

<p>"She's expecting a friend on to-night's train," said
Mrs. Wiley; "Nellie says it's a girl younger than she
is."</p>

<p>"There'll be trouble then," said Mrs. Ray, with the
calmness of all prophets of evil; "a girl younger than
she is is going to make her look awful old."</p>

<p>"I wonder how long they'll stay!"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You never can tell how long any
one will stay here. Some come and say 'Oh, it's so
quiet,' and the next morning the express has got to be
flagged to take 'em right away; and others come and
say 'Oh, it's so quiet,' and send for their trunks and
paint-boxes that night. You never can tell how this
place is going to strike any one. Mr. Ray's first wife
cried all the time, till she died of asthma brought on
by hay-fever; and his second wife liked to be where
she could go without her false teeth, and she just loved
it here! Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"It isn't so very long till the train now," said Mrs.
Wiley; "I guess I'll go down to the station. I always
like to see the train come in. It's so sort of amusing to
think it's going to Buffalo. Lottie Ann says it's so
funny to think of something being right here with us,
and then going right to Buffalo. I wish Lottie Ann
could travel more. Lottie Ann would be a great traveller
if she could travel any."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray took up the lamp. "Well, if you must go,"
she said, "I'll put the light in the post-office and get
down cellar, myself. I'm raising celery odd minutes
this year, and getting the beds ready to lay it under
is a lot of work."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley rose and moved slowly towards the door.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
"I wonder how long those other two will stay at
Nellie's," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray's lips drew tightly together. "I can't say
I'm sure," she said; "I know nothing about them.
Folks who never write letters nor get letters don't
cut any figure in my life. Good night, Mrs. Wiley,"&mdash;she
opened the door as she spoke&mdash;"good-by."</p>

<p>"They've been there&mdash;" murmured Mrs. Wiley,
but the door closing behind her ended her speech.<span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h3">THE COMING OF THE LASSIE</p>

<p>On that same evening Alva and Ingram, the main
subject of Mrs. Ray's and Mrs. Wiley's discourse,
sat in the dining-room of the O'Neil House, waiting for
train time. They had the dining-room to themselves,
except for occasional vague and interjectional appearances
of Mary Cody in the door, to see "if they wanted
anything." Ingram had been eating,&mdash;he was late,
always late,&mdash;and Alva sat watching him in the absent-minded
way in which she was apt to contemplate the
doings of other people, while she talked to him with
the earnest interest which she always gave to talking,&mdash;when
she talked at all. The contrast between her
dreamy eyes and the intentness of her tone was as
great as the contrast between the first impression
wrought by a glance at her colorless face and simple
dress, and the second, when, with a start, the onlooker
realized that here was some one well worth looking
at, well worth studying, and well worth meditating
later. Perhaps she was not beautiful&mdash;I am not
quite sure as to that&mdash;but she was surely lovely, with
the loveliness which a certain sort of life brings to some
faces.</p>

<p>Ingram, on the other side of the table, was just the
ordinary good-looking, professional man of thirty to
thirty-five. Tall, straight, slightly tanned, as would be<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
natural for a civil engineer who had spent September in
the open; especially well-groomed for a man sixty
miles from what he called civilization, fine to see in
his knickerbockers and laced shoes, genial, jolly, and
appreciative to the limit, apparently.</p>

<p>The contrast between the two was very great, and
was felt by more than Mrs. Ray, for there had been
many who had watched them during the week of Alva's
stay. "He's a awful nice man," Mrs. O'Neil had said
to Mrs. Ray, "but I don't see how she ever came to
fancy him. They seem happy together, but it's such a
funny way to be happy together."</p>

<p>This had been the original form of the statement
which Mrs. Ray had later repeated to Mrs. Wiley.</p>

<p>It was true that they seemed very far apart, but were
nevertheless apparently happy together. The week
had been a pleasant week to both. Not, perhaps, as
the town supposed, but pleasant anyway.</p>

<p>"I'm selfish enough to wish that it wasn't at an end
to-night," Ingram said, as he took his piece of blackberry
pie from Mary Cody; "you're a godsend in this
place, Alva."</p>

<p>"But you'll like Lassie," his companion replied;
"she's a charming little girl,&mdash;and I love her so. I
always have loved the child, and just now it seemed to
me as if it would do both her and me good to be together.
Life for me is so wonderful&mdash;I don't like to
be selfish with these days. My thoughts are too happy
to keep to myself. I want some one to share my
joy."</p>

<p>Ingram looked at her quizzically. "And I won't
do at all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You,&mdash;oh, you're away all day. And then,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
besides, you're still so material, so awfully material.
You can't deny it, Ronald, you're frightfully material&mdash;practical&mdash;commonplace.
Of the world so very
worldly."</p>

<p>He laughed lightly. "Just because I don't agree
with you about the dam," he said; "there, that's it,
you know. Why, my dear girl, suppose all America
had been reserved for its beauty, set aside for the perpetual
preservation of the buffaloes and the scenery,&mdash;where
would you and I be now?"</p>

<p>She looked away from him in her curious, contemplative
way. "If you knew," she said, after a minute,
"how silly and petty and trivial such arguments sound
to thinking people, you'd positively blush with shame
to use them. It's like arguing with a baby to try to
talk Heaven's reason with the ordinary man; he just
sees his own little, narrow, earthly standpoint. I wonder
whether it's worth while to ever try to be serious with
you. You know very well that the most of your
brethren would be willing to wreck the Yellowstone
from end to end, if they could make their own private
and personal fortunes building railways through it."</p>

<p>Ingram laughed again. "Where would the country
be without railroads?" he asked.</p>

<p>She withdrew the meaning in her gaze out of the
infinite beyond, where it seemed to float easily, and
centred it on him.</p>

<p>"Just to think," she said, with deep meaning,
"that ten years ago I might have married you, and had
to face your system of logic for life!"</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that?"</p>

<p>"It might have been. We might have made it so
before we knew better. That's the rub in marriage.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
Every one does it before he or she has settled his or
her own views. I wasn't much of an idealist ten years
ago, and you were not much of anything. But if I
could have married any one then, I should have married
you."</p>

<p>A shadow fell upon his face. He turned his chair
a little from the table. "If I was not the right one, I
wish that you had married some other man then,&mdash;I
wish it with all my heart. You would have been so
much happier. You're not happy now&mdash;you know
that. It would have been so much better for you if
you had married."</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head. "Oh, no. It is
much better as it is. Infinitely better. It's like coming
up against a great granite wall to try and talk to you,
Ronald, because you simply cannot understand what
I mean when I say words, but nevertheless, believe me,
I'm on my knees day and night, figuratively speaking,
thanking God that I didn't marry then. I wasn't
meant to marry then. I've been needed single."</p>

<p>He took out his cigarette case. "What were you
meant for, then, do you think?" he queried; "nothing
except as a convenience for others?"</p>

<p>"I was meant to learn, and then later, perhaps, to
teach."</p>

<p>"To learn?" He looked his question with a quick
intensity. "To teach?&mdash;" the question deepened
sharply.</p>

<p>She smiled. "Yes. To learn so that I could teach.
I feel some days that I was born to teach, and of course
no one may hope to teach until he has learned first."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and laughed a little. She
smiled again. "You great, granite wall, you don't<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
understand a bit, do you? Never mind, light your
cigarette, and then tell me what time it is. We must
not forget Lassie, you know."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. "Ten minutes yet."</p>

<p>"Dear child, how tired she'll be. Never mind,
she'll have a good rest during the next ten days."</p>

<p>"Will she stay ten days? She'll be here as long as
you will then, won't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm going when she does."</p>

<p>"You think that the house will be done by that
time?"</p>

<p>"I know that it will be done. It must be done."</p>

<p>He took his cigarette up in his fingers, turned it
about a little, and then looked suddenly straight at
her. "Alva, tell me the mystery, tell me the story,
please. What is the house for?"</p>

<p>She looked at him and was silent.</p>

<p>"Why won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>Still silence. Still she looked at him.</p>

<p>"You'll tell her when she comes. Why not me?"</p>

<p>She spoke then: "She'll be able to understand,
perhaps. You couldn't."</p>

<p>Ingram compressed his lips. "And am I so awfully
dense?" he asked, half hurt.</p>

<p>"Not so dense, but, as yet, too ignorant. Or else
it is that I am still too little myself to be able to rise
above some human sentiments. And there is one point
where endurance of the world's opinion is such refinement
of torture, that only the very strongest and
greatest can go willingly forward to meet and suffer
the inevitable. The inevitable is close to me these days;
it is approaching closer hourly, and there is no possible
way for me to make you or the world understand<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
how I feel in regard to it all. And I shrink
from facing the kind of thing that I shall soon have to
face any sooner than is absolutely necessary. And
so I won't tell you."</p>

<p>She stopped. Although her voice was firm, her eyes
had again become far away in their expression, and she
seemed almost to have forgotten him even while making
this explanation for his sake. He was watching her
with deepest interest, and the curiosity in his eyes
burned more brightly than ever.</p>

<p>"But if it is all as terrible as you make out," he said,
"how can you make that young girl understand what
you suppose to be so far beyond me?"</p>

<p>"Because I can teach her."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"She'll be with me night and day for ten days. We'll
have a good deal of time together. And then, too, she
is a woman. Women learn some lessons easily. Easier
far than men."</p>

<p>"Is it right to teach her such a lesson as this?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that, when you do not know what
my lesson will be? How can you dare fancy that it
could possibly be wrong?"</p>

<p>Ingram paused for a minute, a little staggered.
Then he said, bluntly: "The world is made up of
reasonable men and women, and it seems to me best
that all men and women should be reasonable. What
isn't reasonable is wrong. Forgive me, Alva, but you
don't sound reasonable."</p>

<p>"You think that I am not reasonable? Therefore
I must be wrong. That's your logic?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. "Perhaps I think you wrong. I must
confess that to me you often seem so."<span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>She thought a minute, considering his standpoint.</p>

<p>"Ronald," she said then, "'reasonable' is a term
that is given its meaning by those in power, isn't that
so? 'Reasonable' is what best serves the ends of
those who generally seek to serve no ends except their
own. It's true that I don't at all care what a few
selfish and near-sighted individuals think of me. I
have thrown in my lot with the unreasonable majority,
the poor, the suffering, and those yet to be born who
are being robbed of their birthright. To leave my
mystery and go back to our familiar difference, there's
the dam to illustrate my exact meaning. The 'reasonable'
use of the river out there is to build a dam, and
so make a few more millionaires and give employment
for a few years to a few thousands of Italians. The
'unreasonable' use to make of the river is to preserve
it intact for tired, weary souls to flee to through all the
future, so that their bodies may breathe God and life
into their being again, and go forth strong. You know
you don't agree with me as to that view of that case,
so how can I expect you to disagree with the general
opinion that the 'reasonable' thing for me to do personally
is to take my life and get all the pleasure that
I can from it? The 'unreasonable' view, the one I
hold myself, is that I have elected to take it and give&mdash;not
get&mdash;all the pleasure that I can with it. Of
course you don't understand that unreasonableness,
and so you don't agree with me; but I can tell you one
thing, Ronald," she leaned forward and suddenly
threw intense meaning into her words, "and that is
this. My story&mdash;my mystery as you call it so often&mdash;is
at once a very old mystery and a very new one. I
have suffered, and I am to suffer, most terribly. The<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
happiness to which I am looking forward is going to
be an ordeal for which all that I have undergone until
now will be none too much preparation. But in the
hour of my keenest agony I shall be happier and more
hopeful than you will ever be able to realize in your life.
Unless you change completely. Take my word for
that."</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, and he rose, too, looking
towards her with eyes that plainly subscribed to Mrs.
Ray's opinion as expressed in the simple vernacular.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I can't understand, and I don't believe,"
he said: "but I am able to meet trains, anyhow."</p>

<p>A large cape lay on an empty chair near by, and she
took it up now.</p>

<p>"But I'm going alone," she said, as she slipped
into it.</p>

<p>"What nonsense. Of course I am not going to let
you go alone."</p>

<p>She looked at him, buttoning the woolen cross-straps
upon the cape as she did so; then she threw one corner
back over her forearm and laid that hand on his,
speaking decidedly.</p>

<p>"I'm going alone to meet her. You know what I
asked you to promise when I came here a week ago,
and you know that you gave me your word that you'd
never interfere with me. Lassie is almost a stranger
to you, and after you have learned to know her as a
young lady there will come years for you two to talk
together, but for me this meeting is something that I
don't want to share. Don't say any more."</p>

<p>"But what will she think," he queried, "when she
and you return together, and here sits a cavalier who<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
didn't trouble himself to accompany one lady through
the dark night to meet another's train?"</p>

<p>"She will think nothing, because she will not see
the cavalier. When we come in, we shall go straight
up-stairs."</p>

<p>Ingram more than smiled now. "Forgive me, Alva,
but you and I are such old, such near, such dear friends,
that I can say to you frankly, as I do say to you frankly
over and over again, I don't understand you."</p>

<p>She laughed at that, and turned towards the
door.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know. I'm very queer, most awfully
queer, in the eyes of every one. But I can tell you, as
I tell them, that the worst of it is only for a little while.
Just a few brief weeks and I shall be again, in most
ways, a normal woman. A woman just like all the
rest again," her back was towards him now, "in most
thing&mdash;in most things."</p>

<p>"Never! You never have been like other women,&mdash;you've
always been different from other women; you
always will be."</p>

<p>"Have I? Shall I? Well, perhaps it's so. I'm
rather glad of it. Most women are stupid, I think.
Poor things!" she sighed.</p>

<p>He followed her as she moved towards the door,
half-vexed, half-laughing:</p>

<p>"And men, Alva, and men. Are they all stupid in
your eyes?"</p>

<p>She had her hand on the knob, and her great cape
was gathered about her in heavy folds.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronald," she said, looking into his look, "if
you had any idea how fearfully stupid they seem to me.
Often and often in the last three years. Even yourself.<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
And ten years ago, when we were eighteen and twenty-five,
I thought you so interesting, too."</p>

<p>He burst out laughing at that,&mdash;it wasn't in him
to take her seriously enough to really mind her "ways"
long.</p>

<p>"But what are we to do, when we are such mere
ordinary creatures? And you know, my dear, that if
the transcendentals like to muse on bridges by moonlight,
some well-educated, commonplace individuals
must build them the bridges first."</p>

<p>"Ah, there you go again. Yes, that's true. One
should never forget that, of course. Particularly when
talking with a man who uses a man's logic."</p>

<p>Then she opened the door, passed quickly into the
hall, and let it close after her.</p>

<p>A lantern was resting on the floor outside, as if in
waiting, and she picked it up and went at once into
the night&mdash;a dark night through which the station
lights and signals, red and yellow, sparkled brightly.</p>

<p>It was a brisk October air that filled that outer world,
and the superabundant vitality of God's country came
glinting, storming, down, up, and across earth, sky,
and ether in between.</p>

<p>"This glorious night!" she thought prayerfully.
"If one might only realize just all it means to be existing
right now." She held the lantern behind her, and saw
her shadow spread forth into space and fade away
beyond. "The train isn't in the block yet," she
thought, glancing at the signal; "that means minutes
long to wait." Quickly she ran down the cinder-path
beside the tracks, and entered the little station where a
crowd of men lounged.</p>

<p>"Is the train on time to-night?" she asked one.<span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>He shook his head. "Half an hour late," he said;
"wreck on the road. Wheel off a car of thrashing-machines
at Kent's."</p>

<p>"A whole half hour?"</p>

<p>"Well, I heard Joey Beall say they was making it
up," said the man; "the station agent's gone home to
supper, or you could ask him."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," Alva said, and turned and
went out.</p>

<p>The night appeared even fairer than before. Her
eyes roamed widely. She thought for a minute of going
back to the hotel and bidding Ingram come out with
her, but then her own mood cried for relief from the
labor of his companionship. We do not give our spirits
credit for what they learn through adapting themselves
to uncongenial companionship. Alva felt hers craved
a rest. "I'll go out on the bridge and wait there," she
told herself; "that will be the right thing,&mdash;to stand
above the gorge and say my evening prayers."</p>

<p>So, stepping carefully over the switch impedimenta,
she walked on, following the embankment that led out
to the Long Bridge.</p>

<p>It is very long&mdash;that Long Bridge&mdash;and very high
as well. I believe that the first bridge, the wooden one,
was close to a world's wonder in its days. Even now
the skilfully combined network of iron, steel, joist and
cable seems a species of marvel, as it springs across the
great cleft that the glacier sawed through several
million layers of Devonian stratum several million
years ago. I forget how many tons of metal went into
its structure, but so intricate and delicately poised is
the whole, that while trains roar forth upon its length
and find no danger, yet does it echo quick and responsive<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
to the light step of a lithe treading woman or even of
the littlest child. On this night Alva, wrapped close
in her cape, fared fearlessly out into the black beyond.
The high braces and beams creaked all along its vanishing
length, and she smiled at the sound. "I wonder
if sometime, years from now, I shall return and walk
out here again, and find the bridge crying me a welcome!"
she thought; "I wonder!" A narrow,
boarded way led to the right of the rails, and she was
soon directly over the gorge. It was far too dark to see
the ribbon of river hundreds and hundreds of feet
below, or the steep picture-crevasse that encased the
water's way. Beyond and below, to the left, she could
have seen the windows of Ledgeville, had she turned
that way, but she did not do so. It was the gorge that
always claimed her, whether by day or by night, and
now she leaned upon the steel guard and stared below.
"I can see it plainly, even in the dark," she murmured
to herself. "I can see every rock and eddy down there,
the great curve of whirlpool, and the place where the
water slides so smoothly off and then goes mad and
foams below. It is all distinct to me. I remember the
day that I first saw it, years ago, when&mdash;right here,
where I stand to-night&mdash;he came to me for the first
time, and we knew one another directly. And I shall
see it just so plainly in the years to come, when it will
never enter into my daily life any more, and yet will
be the background of all my living."</p>

<p>She stood there for a long time, wrapped in the depth
of her own thoughts. The shadows below seemed to
shift and drift in their variations of intensity, and her
eyes found rest in their profundity. "It's like drawing
water out of a well when one is very thirsty," she said,
<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>at last, straightening herself and sighing; "it's unexplainable,
but oh, it's so good,&mdash;the lesson of darkness
and water and trees and sky. How grateful I am to be
able to spell out a little in that primer!"</p>

<p>Then she clasped her hands and said a prayer, and
as she finished the signal flashed the train's entrance
within the block. That meant only two minutes until
its arrival, and so she turned herself back at once.
The crowd at the station had perceptibly increased
and began now to surge forth upon the platform. Mrs.
Dunstall was there and Pinkie, and Joey Beall and Mrs.
Wiley, and Clay Wright Benton, and old Sammy
Adams, and Lucia Cosby.</p>

<p>"Been out on the Bridge, I suppose?" Mrs. Dunstall
said pleasantly to Alva.</p>

<p>"Yes; it's lovely to-night," the latter replied.</p>

<p>Every one smiled. They all felt that any one who
would go out on the bridge on a pitch black night must
be mildly insane, but they looked upon Alva as mildly
insane anyhow. Mrs. Ray had many beside Ingram
to uphold her opinion.</p>

<p>"It's her that bought the old Whittacker house and
is putting a bath-tub in it," Joey Beall whispered to
a man who was waiting to leave by the last train out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="gs02" id="gs02"></a>
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="400" height="633" alt="&quot;IT&#39;S HER THAT BOUGHT THE OLD WHITTACKER HOUSE.&quot;" title="">
</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;IT&#39;S HER THAT BOUGHT THE OLD WHITTACKER HOUSE.&quot;</p>

<p>"I know it," said the man; he was one of those men
who never let Joey or anybody else feel that he had any
advantage of him, in even the slightest way.</p>

<p>Just then the train charged madly in beside them.</p>

<p>Lassie, out on the Pullman's rear platform, preparatory
to climbing down the steep steps the instant that
it should be allowable, saw a well-known figure wrapped
in a dark cloak, and gave a little cry of joy&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alva! Here I am&mdash;all safe."<span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>Then she was enwrapped in the same dark cloak
herself, for the space of one warm, all-embracing hug,
her friend repeating over and over, "I'm so happy to
have you&mdash;so happy to have you." And then they
moved away through the little group of bystanders,
and started up the cinder-path towards the hotel.</p>

<p>"I'm so happy to have you!" Alva exclaimed again,
when they were alone. She did not even seem to know
that she had said so before.</p>

<p>"It was so good of you to ask me! How did you come
to think of it? And oh, Alva, what are you doing here,
in this lonely place?"</p>

<p>"It will take me all your visit to properly answer
those questions, dear; but I'll tell you this much at
once. I asked you because I wanted to have you with
me, and because I thought that you and I could help
one another a great deal right now. And I am here,
dear, because I am the happiest woman that the world
has ever seen, and because the greatest happiness that
the world has ever known is to be here in a few weeks."</p>

<p>Lassie stopped short, astonished.</p>

<p>Alva went on, laughing gaily: "Yes, it is so! Come
on,&mdash;or you will stumble without my lantern to guide
you. I'm going to tell you all about everything when we
get alone in our room, but now, little girl, hurry, hurry.
Don't stop behind."</p>

<p>So Lassie swallowed her astonishment for the time
being, and followed.</p>

<p>The hotel stood on the crest of the hill above the
station and the railway's path curved by it. They were
there in a minute, and in another minute alone up-stairs
in their room&mdash;or rather, rooms&mdash;for there
were two bedrooms, opening one into the other.<span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>"Why, how pretty you have made them," the young
girl cried; "pictures, and a real live tea-table. And a
work-stand! How cosy and dear! It's just as if you
meant to live here always."</p>

<p>Her face glowed, as she absorbed the surprising
charm of her new abode. One does not need to be very
old or to have travelled very extensively to recognize
some comforts as pleasingly surprising in the
country.</p>

<p>Alva was hanging up her cloak, and now she came
and began to undo the traveller's with a loving touch.</p>

<p>"Why, in one way I do mean to live here always,
dear. I never am anywhere that I do not&mdash;in a certain
sense&mdash;live there ever after. People and places never
fade out of my life. Wherever I have once been is
forever near and dear to me, so dear that I can't bear
to remember anybody or anything there as ugly. The
difference between a pretty room and an ugly one is
only a little money and a few minutes, after all, and I'm
beginning to learn to apply the same rule to people.
It only takes a little to find something interesting about
each. We'll be so happy here, Lassie; how we will talk
and sew and drink tea in these two tiny rooms! I've
been just feasting on the thought of it every minute
since you wrote that you could come."</p>

<p>Lassie hugged her again. "I can't tell you how overjoyed
I was to think of coming and having a whole
fortnight of you to myself. Every one thought it was
droll, my running off like this when I ought to be deep
in preparations for my d&eacute;but, but mamma said that the
rest and change would do me good. And I was so
glad!"</p>

<p>Alva had gone to hang up the second cloak and now<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
she turned, smiling her usual quiet sweet smile as she
did so.</p>

<p>"It's a great thing for me to have you, dear; I
haven't been lonely, but my life has been so happy here
that I have felt selfish over keeping so much rare,
sweet, unutterable joy all to myself,&mdash;I wanted to
share it."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the side of the bed, and held
out her hand in invitation, and Lassie accepted the
invitation and went and perched beside her.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," she said, nestling childishly
close; "how long have you been here anyway?"</p>

<p>"A week to-day."</p>

<p>"Only a week! Why, you wrote me a week ago."</p>

<p>"No, dear, six days ago."</p>

<p>"But you spoke as if you had been here ever so long
then."</p>

<p>"Did I? It seemed to me that I had been here a long
time, I suppose. Time doesn't go with me as regularly
as it should, I believe. Some years are days, and the
first day here was a year."</p>

<p>"And why are you here, Alva?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a long story."</p>

<p>"But tell it me, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Wait till to-morrow, dearest; wait until to-morrow,
until you see my house."</p>

<p>"Your house!"</p>

<p>"I've bought a house here,&mdash;a dear little old
Colonial dwelling hidden behind a high evergreen
wall."</p>

<p>"A house here&mdash;in Ledge?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, not in Ledge&mdash;in Ledgeville. Across
the bridge&mdash;"<span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>"But when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A week ago&mdash;the day I came."</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alva leaned her face down against the bright brown
head.</p>

<p>"I wanted a home of my own, Lassie."</p>

<p>"But I thought that you couldn't leave your father
and mother?"</p>

<p>"I can't, dear."</p>

<p>"Are they coming here to live?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you will to-morrow; I'll tell you everything
to-morrow; I'd tell you to-night, only that I promised
myself that we would go to a certain dear spot, and sit
there alone in the woods while I told you."</p>

<p>"Why in the woods?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Lassie, because I love the woods; I've gotten
so fond of woods, you don't know how fond; trees and
grass have come to be such friends to me; I'll tell you
about it all later. It's all part of the story."</p>

<p>"But why did you come here, Alva,&mdash;here of all
places, where you don't know any one. For you don't
know any one here, do you?"</p>

<p>"I know a man named Ronald Ingram here; he is
the chief of the engineering party that is surveying for
the dam."</p>

<p>"Is he an old friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, from my childhood."</p>

<p>Lassie turned quickly, her eyes shining:</p>

<p>"Alva, are you going to marry him?"</p>

<p>Her face was so bright and eager that something
veiled the eyes of the other with tears as she answered:<span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>"No, dear; he's nothing but a friend. I was looking
for a house&mdash;a house in the wilderness&mdash;and he sent
for me to come and see one here. And I came and
saw it and bought it at once; I expect to see it in
order in less than a fortnight."</p>

<p>"Then you're going to spend this winter here?"</p>

<p>Alva nodded. "Part of it at any rate."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>Alva shook her head.</p>

<p>Lassie's big eyes grew yet more big. "Do you
mean&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;oh, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>She leaned forward, looking eagerly up into the
other's face. "Alva, Alva, it isn't&mdash;it can't be&mdash;oh,
then you are really&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two great tears rolled down that other woman's
face. She simply bowed her head and said nothing.</p>

<p>Lassie stared speechless for a minute; then&mdash;"I'm
so glad&mdash;so glad," she stammered, "so glad. And
you'll tell me all about it to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," Alva whispered, "I'll tell you all
to-morrow. I'll be glad to tell it all to you. The truth
is, Lassie, that I thought that I was strong enough to
live these days alone, but I learned that I am weaker
than I thought. You see how weak I am. I am weeping
now, but they are tears of joy, believe me&mdash;they are
tears of joy; I am the happiest and most blessed
woman in the whole wide world. And yet, it is your
coming that leads me to weep. I had to have some
outlet, dear, some one to whom to speak. And I
want to live, Lassie, and be strong, very, very strong&mdash;for
God."</p>

<p>Lassie sat staring.</p>

<p>"You don't understand, do you?" Alva said to<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
her, with the same smile with which she had put the
same question to Ingram.</p>

<p>But Lassie did not answer the question as Ingram
had answered it.</p>

<p>"You will teach me and I shall learn to understand,"
she said.<span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h3">INTRODUCING LASSIE TO MRS. RAY</p>

<p>The next morning dawned gorgeous.</p>

<p>When Lassie, in her little gray kimono, stole
gently in to wake her friend, she found Alva already
up and dressed, standing at the window, looking out
over the October beauty that spread afar before her.
It was a wonderful sight, all the trees bright and yet
brighter in their autumn gladness, while the grass
sparkled green through the dew that had been frost
an hour before. The view showed the radiance fading
off into the distant blue, where bare brown fields told
of the harvest garnered and the ground made ready
for another spring.</p>

<p>Lassie pressed Alva's arm as she peeped over her
shoulder, and the other turned in silence and kissed
her tenderly.</p>

<p>Side by side they looked forth together for some
minutes longer, and then Lassie whispered:</p>

<p>"I could hardly get to sleep last night&mdash;for thinking
of it all, you know. You don't guess how interested
I am. I do so want to know everything."</p>

<p>Alva turned to regard her with her calm smile.</p>

<p>"But when you did get to sleep, you slept well,
didn't you?" she asked; "tell me that, first of all."</p>

<p>"Why, is it late? Did I sleep too awfully long?
Why didn't you call me?"<span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, why? It's barely nine, and that
isn't late at all for a girl who spent all yesterday on the
train. I let you sleep on purpose. What's the use of
waking up before the mail comes? And that isn't in
till half-past under the most favorable circumstances;
and even then it never is distributed until quarter to
ten. I thought we'd get our letters after our breakfast,
and then carry them across the bridge with us. Would
you like to do that? I have to cross the bridge every
morning."</p>

<p>"Cross the bridge? That means to go to your
house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"How nice! I'm crazy to see your house. Is it far
from here to the post-office? Will that be on our way?"</p>

<p>"That is the post-office there&mdash;by the trees."
Alva pointed to a brown, two-story, cottage-like
structure three hundred yards further up the track.</p>

<p>"The little house with the box nailed to the gate-post?"</p>

<p>"It isn't such a little house, Lassie; it's quite a
mansion. The lady who lives in it rents the upper
part for a flat and takes boarders down-stairs."</p>

<p>"Does she take many?"</p>

<p>Alva laughed. "She told me that she only had a
double-bed and a half-bed, so she was limited to eight."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I know, my dear, I thought that very same 'Oh'
myself; but that's what she said. And that really is as
naught compared to the rest of her capabilities."</p>

<p>"What else does she do?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't remember it all at once, but
among other things she runs a farm, raises chickens,<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
takes in sewing, cuts hair, canes chairs and is sexton
of the church. She's postmistress, too, and does
several little things around town."</p>

<p>Lassie drew back in amazement. "You're joking."</p>

<p>"No, dear, I'm not joking. She's the eighth wonder
in the world, in my opinion."</p>

<p>"She must be quite a character."</p>

<p>"Every one's quite a character in the country.
Country life develops character. I expect to become
a character myself, very soon; indeed I'm not very
positive but that I am one already."</p>

<p>"But how does the woman find time to do so much?"</p>

<p>"There is more time in the country than in the
city; you'll soon discover that. One gets up and
dresses and breakfasts and goes for the mail, and reads
the letters and answers them, and then its only quarter
past ten,&mdash;in the country."</p>

<p>Lassie withdrew from the arm that held her. "It
won't be so with me to-day, at all events," she laughed.
"What will they think of me if every one here is as
prompt as that?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter to-day; we'll be prompt ourselves
to-morrow. But you'd better run now. I'm in a hurry
to get to my house; I'm as silly over that house as a
little child with a new toy,&mdash;sillier, in fact, for my
interest is in ratio with my growth, and I've wanted a
home for so long."</p>

<p>"But you've had a home."</p>

<p>"Not of my very ownest own, not such as this will
be."</p>

<p>The young girl looked up into her face. "I'm so <i>very</i>
curious," she said, with emphasis; "I want so to
know the story."<span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>Alva touched her cheek caressingly, "I'll tell you
soon," she promised, "after you've seen the house."</p>

<p>Lassie went back into her room and proceeded to
make her toilet, which was soon finished.</p>

<p>They went down into the little hotel dining-room
then for breakfast, and found it quite deserted, but
neat and sweet, and pleasantly odorous of bacon.</p>

<p>"Such a dolls' house of a hotel," said Lassie.</p>

<p>"It's a cozy place," Alva answered. "I like this
kind of hotel. It's sweet and informal. If they forget
you, you can step to the kitchen and ask for more
coffee. I'm tired of the world and the world's conventionality.
I told Mrs. Lathbun yesterday that Ledge
would spoil me for civilization hereafter. I like to
live in out-of-the-way places."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lathbun is the hostess, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. O'Neil is the hostess, or rather, she's
the host's wife. You must meet her to-day. Such a
pretty, brown-eyed, girlish creature,&mdash;the last woman
in the world to bring into a country hotel. She says
herself that when you've been raised with a faucet
and a sewer, it's terrible to get used to a cistern and a
steep bank. She was born and brought up in Buffalo."</p>

<p>By this time Mary Cody had entered, beaming good
morning, and placed the hot bacon and eggs, toast and
coffee, before them.</p>

<p>"I'm going for the mail after breakfast, Mary,"
Alva said; "shall I bring yours?"</p>

<p>"Can't I bring yours?" said Mary Cody. "I can
run up there just as well as not." Mary Cody was all
smiles at the mere idea.</p>

<p>"No, I'll have to go myself to-day, I think. I'm
expecting a registered letter."<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>"I'll be much obliged then if you will bring mine."</p>

<p>"If there are any for the house, I'll bring them all,"
Alva said; "will you tell Mrs. Lathbun that?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell her if I see her, but they're both gone. They
went out early&mdash;off chestnutting, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Who is Mrs. Lathbun?" Lassie asked, when Mary
Cody had gone out of the room.</p>

<p>"I spoke of her before and you asked about her
then, didn't you? And I meant to tell you and forgot.
She's another boarder, a lady who is here with her
daughter. Such nice, plain, simple people. You'll
like them both."</p>

<p>"I thought that we were to be here all alone."</p>

<p>"We are, to all intents and purposes. The Lathbuns
won't trouble us. They are not intrusive, only interesting
when we meet at table or by accident."</p>

<p>"Every one interests you, Alva; but I don't like
strangers."</p>

<p>Alva sighed and smiled together.</p>

<p>"I learned to fill my life with interest in people long
ago," she said simply; "it's the only way to keep from
getting narrow sometimes."</p>

<p>Lassie looked at her earnestly.</p>

<p>"Does every one that you meet interest you really?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I think so; I hope so, anyway."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever find any one dull?"</p>

<p>Alva looked at her with a smile, quickly repressed.
"No one is really dull, dear, or else every one is dull;
it's all in the view-point. The interest is there if we
want it there; or it isn't there, if we so prefer. That's
all."<span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>There was a little pause, while the young girl thought
this over.</p>

<p>"I suppose that one is happiest in always trying to
find the interest," she said then slowly; "but do tell
me more about the Lathbuns."</p>

<p>"Presupposing them in the dull catalogue?"</p>

<p>Lassie blushed, "Not necessarily," she said, half
confusedly.</p>

<p>Alva laughed at her face, "I don't know so very
much about them, except that they interest me. The
mother is large and rather common looking, but a very
fine musician, and the daughter is a pale, delicate girl
with a romance."</p>

<p>Lassie's face lit up: "Oh, a romance! Is it a nice
romance? Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"It's rather a wonderful romance in my eyes. I'll
tell it all to you sometime, but that was the train that
came in just now, and I want to get the mail and go
on over to the house, so we'll have to put off the romance
for the present, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I don't hear the train."</p>

<p>"Maybe not&mdash;but it went by."</p>

<p>"Went by! And the mail! How does the mail get
off by itself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I must leave you to learn about the
mail from Mrs. Ray. She'll explain to you all about
what happens to the Ledge mail when the train rushes
by. It's one of her pet subjects."</p>

<p>"Do you know you're really very clever, Alva; you
seem to be plotting to fill me full of curiosity about
everything and everybody in this little out-of-the-way
corner in the world? Nobody could ever be dull where
you are."<span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>A sudden shadow fell over the older's face at that;
a wistful wonder crept to her eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe that," she said.</p>

<p>"But you can, dear. You've always seemed to me
to be just like that French woman who was the only
one who could amuse the king, even after she'd been
his wife for forty years. You'd be like that."</p>

<p>Alva rose, laughing a little sadly. "God grant that
it may be so," she said, "there are so many people who
need amusing after forty years. But, dear, you know
I told you last night that I sent for you to come and
teach and learn, and you are teaching already."</p>

<p>"What am I teaching?" Lassie's eyes opened
widely.</p>

<p>"You are teaching me what I really am, and that's
a lesson that I need very much just now. It would be
so very easy to forget what I really am these days. My
head is so often dizzy."</p>

<p>"Why, dear? What makes you dizzy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because the world seems slipping from me so
fast. I could so easily quit it altogether. And I must
not quit it. I have too much to do. And I am to have
a great task left me to perform, perhaps. Oh, Lassie,
it's hopeless to tell you anything until I have begun by
telling you everything. You'll see then why I want to
die, and why I can't."</p>

<p>"Alva!"</p>

<p>"Don't be shocked, dear; you don't know what I
mean at all now, but later you will. Come, we must be
going. No time to waste to-day."</p>

<p>They went up-stairs for hats and wraps, and then came
down ready for the October sunshine. It was fine to
step into the crispness and breathe the ozone of its<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
glory. On the big stone cistern cover by the door a
fat little girl sat, hugging a cat and swinging her feet
so as to kick caressingly the brown and white hound
that lay in front of her.</p>

<p>"A nice, round, rosy picture of content," Alva said,
smiling at the tot. "I love to see babies and animals
stretched out in the sun, enjoying just being alive."</p>

<p>"I enjoy just being alive myself," said Lassie.</p>

<p>They went up the path that ran beside the road and,
arriving at the post-office, turned in at the gate and
climbed the three steps. The post-office door stuck,
and Alva jammed it open with her knee. Then she
went in, followed by Lassie.</p>

<p>The post-office was just an extremely small room,
two thirds of which appeared reserved for groceries,
ranged upon shelves or piled in three of its four corners.
The fourth corner belonged to the United States
Government, and was screened off by a system of
nine times nine pigeonholes, all empty. Behind the
pigeonholes Mrs. Ray was busy stamping letters for
the outgoing mail.</p>

<p>"You never said that she kept a grocery store, too,"
whispered Lassie.</p>

<p>"No, but I told you that I'd forgotten ever so many
things that she did," whispered Alva in return.</p>

<p>The lady behind the counter calmly continued her
stamping, and paid not the slightest attention to them.</p>

<p>They sat down upon two of the three wooden chairs
that were ranged in front of a pile of sacks of flour and
remained there, meekly silent, until some one with a
basket came in and took the remaining wooden chair.
All three united then in adopting and maintaining the
reverential attitude of country folk awaiting the mail's<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
distribution, and Lassie learned for the first time in her
life how strong and binding so intangible a force as
personal influence and atmosphere may become, even
when it be only the personal influence and atmosphere
of a country postmistress. It may be remarked in
passing, that not one of the letters then being post-marked
received an imprint anything like as strong as
that frame of mind which the postmistress of Ledge
had the power to impress upon those who came under
her sceptre. She never needed to speak, she never
needed to even glance their way, but her spirit reigned
triumphant in her kingdom, and, as she carried her
governmental duties forward with as deep a realization
of their importance as the most zealous political
reformer could wish, no onlooker could fail to feel
anything but admiration for her omniscience and
omnipotence. Mrs. Ray's governmental attitude towards
life showed itself in an added seriousness of expression.
Her dress was always plain and severe, and
in the post-office she invariably put over her shoulders
a little gray shawl with fringe which she had a way of
tucking in under her arms from time to time as she
moved about.</p>

<p>Lassie had ample time to note all this while the
stamping went vigorously forward. Meanwhile the
mail-bag which had just arrived lay lean and lank
across the counter, appearing as resigned as the three
human beings ranged on the chairs opposite. Finally,
when the last letter was post-marked, the postmistress
turned abruptly, jerked out a drawer, drew therefrom
a key which hung by a stout dog-chain to the drawer
knob and held it carefully as if for the working up of
some magic spell. Lassie, contemplating every move<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
with the closest attention, could not but think just
here that if the postal key of Ledge ever had decided
to lose its senses and rush madly out into the whirlwind
of wickedness which it may have fancied existing
beyond, it would assuredly not have gotten far with
that chain holding it back, and Mrs. Ray holding the
chain. It was a fearfully large and imposing chain,
and seemed, in some odd way, to be Mrs. Ray's assistant
in maintaining the dignity necessary to their dual
position in the world's eyes.</p>

<p>The lady of the post-office now unlocked the bag
and, thrusting her hand far in, secured two packets
containing nine letters in all from the yawning depths.
She carefully examined each letter, and then turned the
bag upside down and gave it one hard, severe, and
solemn shake. Nothing falling out, she placed it on
top of a barrel, took up the nine letters, and went to
work upon them next.</p>

<p>When they were all duly stamped, she laid them,
address-side up, before her like a pack of fortune-telling
cards, folded her arms tightly across her bosom,
and, standing immovable, directed her gaze straight
ahead.</p>

<p>Now seemed to be the favorable instant for consulting
the sacred oracle. Alva and the third lady rose
with dignity and approached the layman's side of the
counter; Lassie sat still, thrilled in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Alva, being a mere visitor, drew back a little with
becoming modesty and gave the native a chance to
speak first.</p>

<p>"I s'pose there ain't nothing for me," said that
other, almost apologetically, "but if there's anything
for Bessie or Edward Griggs or Ellen Scott I can take<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
it; and John is going down the St. Helena road
this afternoon, so if there's anything for Judy and
Samuel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here's yours as usual," said Mrs. Ray, rising
calmly above the other's speech and handing Alva
three letters as she did so; "the regular one, and the
one you get daily, and then here's a registered one.
I shall require a receipt for the registered one, as the
United States Government holds me legally liable
otherwise, and after my husband died I made up my
mind I was all done being legally liable for anything
unless I had a receipt. Yes, indeed. I'd been liable
sometimes legally in my married life, but more often
just by being let in for it, and I quit then. Yes, indeed.
When they tell me I'm legally liable for anything now,
I never fail to get a receipt, and I read every word of
the President's message over twice every year to be
sure I ain't being given any chance to get liable accidentally
when I don't know it&mdash;when I ain't took
in what was being enacted, you know. Here,&mdash;here's
the things and the ink; you sign 'em all, please."</p>

<p>Alva bent above the counter obediently and proceeded
to fill out the forms as according to law. Mrs.
Ray watched her sharply until the one protecting her
own responsibility had been indorsed, and then she
turned to the other inquirer:</p>

<p>"Now, what was you saying, Mrs. Dunstall? Oh,
I remember,&mdash;no, of course there ain't anything for
you. Nor for any of them except the Peterkins, and
I daren't give you their mail because they writ me last
time not to ever do so again. I told Mrs. Peterkin you
meant it kindly, but she don't like that law as
lets you open other people's letters and then write<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
on 'Opened by accident.' Mrs. Peterkin makes a
point of opening her own letters. She says her husband
even don't darst touch 'em. It's nothing against you,
Mrs. Dunstall, for she's just the same when I write
on 'Received in bad order.' She always comes right
down and asks me why I did it. Yes, indeed. I suppose
she ain't to blame; some folks is funny; they never
will be pleasant over having their letters opened."</p>

<p>Alva bent closer over her writing; Lassie was
coughing in her handkerchief. Mrs. Dunstall stood
before the counter as if nailed there, and continued to
receive the whole charge full in her face.</p>

<p>"But I've got your hat done for you; yes, I have.
I dyed the flowers according to the Easter egg recipe,
and it's in the oven drying now. And I made you that
cake, too. And I've got the setting of hens' eggs all
ready. Just as soon as the mail is give out, I'll get 'em
all for you. It's pretty thick in the kitchen, or you
could go out there to wait, but Elmer Haskins run his
lawn-mower over his dog's tail yesterday, and the dog's
so lost confidence in Elmer in consequence, that Elmer
brought him up to me to take care of. He's a nice
dog, but he won't let no one but me set foot in the
kitchen to-day. I don't blame him, I'm sure. He was
sleepin' by Deacon Delmar's grave in the cemetery
and woke suddenly to find his tail gone. It's a lesson
to me never to leave the grave-cutting to no one else
again. I'd feel just as the dog does, if I'd been through
a similar experience. Yes, indeed. I was telling
Sammy Adams last night and he said the same."</p>

<p>"There, Mrs. Ray," said Alva, in a stifled voice,
straightening up as she spoke, "I think that will set
you free from all liability; I've signed them all."<span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>"Let me see,&mdash;you mustn't take it odd that I'm
so particular, because a government position is a
responsibility as stands no feeling." She looked at the
signatures carefully, one after the other. "Yes, they're
right," she said then; "it wasn't that I doubted you,
but honesty's the best policy, and I ought to know, for
it was the only policy my husband didn't let run out
before he died without telling me. He had four when
I married him&mdash;just as many as he had children by
his first wife&mdash;he had six by his second&mdash;and his name
and the fact that it was a honest one, was all he left
me to live on and bring up his second wife's children
on. Goodness knows what he done with his money; he
certainly didn't lay it by for the moths and rust, for
I'm like the text in the Bible&mdash;wherever are moths
and rust there am I, too. Yes, indeed, and with
pepper and sapolio into the bargain; but no, the money
wasn't there, for if it was where it could rust it would
be where I could get it."</p>

<p>Alva smiled sympathetically, and then she and
Lassie almost rushed out into the open air. When
they were well out of hearing, they dared to
laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, my gracious me," Lassie cried; "how can
you stand it and stay sober?"</p>

<p>"I can't, that's the trouble!" Alva gasped. "My
dear, she felt strange before you, and was rather
reticent, but wait till she knows you well&mdash;until to-morrow.
Oh, Lassie, she's too amusing! Wait till
she gets started about the dam, or about Niagara, or
about her views on running a post-office, or anything&mdash;"
she was stopped by Lassie's seizing her
arm.<span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>"Look quick, over there,&mdash;who is that? He looks
so out of place here, somehow. Don't he? Just like
civilization."</p>

<p>Alva looked. "That? Oh, that's Ronald&mdash;Ronald
Ingram, you know, coming across lots for his letters.
You remember him, surely, when you were a little girl.
He was always at our house then. You'll meet him
again to-night. I'd stop now and introduce you, only
I want to hurry."</p>

<p>"I suppose that he knows all about it?"</p>

<p>"All about what?"</p>

<p>"The secret."</p>

<p>"Ronald? Oh, no, dear. No one knows. No one&mdash;that
is, except&mdash;except we two. You will be the
only outsider to share that secret."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"Until I am married."</p>

<p>"Until you are married! Why, when are you to be
married?&mdash;Soon?"</p>

<p>"In a fortnight."</p>

<p>"And no one is to know!"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Not his family? Not yours?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"How strange!"</p>

<p>Alva put out her hand and stayed the words upon
her friend's lips. "Look, dear, this is the Long Bridge.
You've heard of it all your life; now we're going to
walk across it. Look to the left; all that lovely scene
of hill and valley and the little white town with green
blinds is Ledgeville; and there to the right is the
famous gorge, with its banks of gray and its chain of
falls, each lovelier than the last. Stand still and just
<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
look; you'll never see anything better worth looking
at if you travel the wide world over."</p>

<p>They stopped and leaned on the bridge-rail in
silence for several minutes, and then Alva continued
softly, almost reverently: "This scene is my existence's
prayer. I can't make you understand all that it means
to me, because you can't think how life comes when one
is crossing the summit&mdash;the very highest peak. I've
climbed for so long,&mdash;I'll be descending upon the other
side for so long,&mdash;but the hours upon the summit are
now, and are wonderful! I should like to be so intensely
conscious that not one second of the joy could
ever fade out of my memory again. I feel that I want
to grave every rock and ripple and branch and bit of
color into me forever. Oh, what I'd give if I might
only do so. I'd have it all to comfort me afterwards
then&mdash;afterwards in the long, lonely years to come."</p>

<p>"Why, Alva," said her friend, turning towards her
in astonishment, "you speak as if you didn't expect
to be happy but for a little while."</p>

<p>A sad, faint smile crept around Alva's mouth, and
then it altered instantly into its usual sweet serenity.</p>

<p>"Come, dear," she said; "we'll hurry on to the
house, and then after you've seen it we'll go to my own
dear forest-seat, and there I'll tell you the whole
story."</p>

<p>"Oh, let us hurry!" Lassie said, impetuously; "I
can't wait much longer."</p>

<p>So they set quickly forward across the Long Bridge.<span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h3">THE DIFFERENCE</p>

<p>On the further side of the Long Bridge the railway
tracks swept off in a smooth curve to the right,
and, as there was a high embankment to adapt the
grade to the hillside, a long flight of steps ran down beside
it into the glen below.</p>

<p>A pretty glen, dark with shadows, bright with dancing
sun-rays. A glen which bore an odd likeness to
some lives that we may meet (if we have that happiness),
lives that lead their ways in peace and beauty, with the
roar and smoke of the world but a stone's throw distant.</p>

<p>Lassie's eyes, looking down, were full of appreciation.</p>

<p>"Is it there that you are going to live?" she asked.</p>

<p>Alva shook her head. "Oh, no, not there; that is
Ledge Park, the place that all the hue and cry is being
raised over just now."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Lassie turned eagerly; "tell me about
that. I read something in the papers, but I forgot
that it was here."</p>

<p>"It is 'here,' as you say. But it concerns all the
country about here, only it's much too big a subject
for us to go into now. There are two sides, and then
ever so many sides more. I try to see them all, I try
to see every one's side of everything as far as I can,<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
but there is one side that overbalances all else in my
eyes, and that happens to be the unpopular one."</p>

<p>"That's too bad."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," Alva spoke very simply; "but what
makes <i>you</i> say so?"</p>

<p>"Why? Why, because then you won't get what
you want."</p>

<p>Her friend laughed. "Don't say that in such a
pitying tone, Lassie. Better to be defeated on the
right side, than to win the most glorious of victories
for the wrong. Who said that?"</p>

<p>Lassie looked doubtful.</p>

<p>Alva laughed again and touched her cheek with a
finger-caress. "I'll tell you just this much now,
dear;&mdash;all of both the river banks&mdash;above, below and
surrounding the three falls&mdash;belong to Mr. Ledge, and he
has always planned to give the whole to the State as a
gift, so that there might be one bit of what this country
once was like, preserved. He made all his arrangements
to that end, and gave the first deeds last winter.
What do you think followed? As soon as the State
saw herself practically in possession, it appointed a
commission to examine into the possibilities of the
water power!" Alva paused and looked at her friend.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Lassie was clearly puzzled.</p>

<p>"The engineers are here surveying now. Ronald
Ingram is at the head and the people of all the neighborhood
are so excited over the prospect of selling
their farms that no one stops to think what it would
really mean."</p>

<p>"What would it really mean?"</p>

<p>"A manufacturing district with a huge reservoir
above it."<span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Back there," she turned and pointed; "they say
that there was a great prehistoric lake there once, and
they will utilize it again."</p>

<p>"But there's a town down there."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, Ledgeville. Ledgeville and six
other towns will be submerged."</p>

<p>Lassie stopped short on the railroad track and
stared. She had come to a calamity which she could
realize now.</p>

<p>"Why, what ever will the people do then?"</p>

<p>"Get damages. They're so pleased over being
drowned out. You must talk it over with Mrs. Ray.
You must get Mrs. Ray's standpoint, and then get
Ronald's standpoint. Theirs are the sensible, practical
views, the world's views. My views are never
practical. I'm not practical. I'm only heartbroken
to think of anything coming in to ruin the valley. Mr.
Ledge and I share the same opinions as to this valley;
it seems to us too great a good to sell for cash."</p>

<p>"You speak bitterly."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I'm afraid that I do speak bitterly. On
that subject. But we won't talk of it any more just
now. See, here's the wood road that leads to my
kingdom; come, take it with me."</p>

<p>They turned into a soft, pine-carpeted way on the
left, and in the length of a bow-shot seemed buried in
the forest.</p>

<p>"Lassie, wait!"</p>

<p>Turning her head, Lassie saw that Alva had stopped
behind, and was standing still beside where a little
pine-tree was growing out from under a big glacial
boulder. She went back to her.<span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>"Dear, look at this little tree. Here's my daily text."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Do you see how it has grown out and struggled
up from under the rock?"</p>

<p>Lassie nodded.</p>

<p>"You know very little of what makes up life, dear.
I've sent for you to teach you." She lifted her eyes
earnestly to the face near hers, and her own eyes were
full of appeal. "Lassie, try to understand all I say to
you these days; try to believe that it's worth learning.
See this little tree&mdash;" she touched her fingers caressingly
to the pine branches as she spoke&mdash;"it's a
very little tree, but it has taught me daily since I
came, and I believe that you can learn of it, too."</p>

<p>Lassie's big eyes were very big indeed. "Learn of
a tree!"</p>

<p>Alva lifted one of the little stunted uneven branches
tenderly in her fingers. "This is its lesson," she said;
"the pine-cone fell between the rocks; it didn't choose
where it would fall, it just found itself alive and under
the rocks; there wasn't much earth there, but it took
root and grew. There was no room to give out branches,
so it forced its way crookedly upward; crookedly because
there was no room to grow straight, but always
upward; there wasn't much sunlight, but it was as
bravely green as any other tree; the big rock made it
one-sided, but it put out thickly on the side where it
had space. My life hasn't been altogether sunlit. I
was born between rocks, and I have been forced to
grow one-sided, too. But the tree's sermon came
home to me the first day that I saw it. Courageous
little tree, doing your best in the woods, where
<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>no one but God could take note of your efforts,&mdash;you'll
be straight and have space and air and sunshine
in plenty next time&mdash;next time! Oh, blessed 'next
time' that is to surely right the woes of those who
keep up courage and continue fighting. That's the
reward of all. That's the lesson."</p>

<p>Lassie listened wonderingly. "Next time!" she
repeated questioningly, "what next time? Do you
believe in a heaven for trees?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure of a heaven for anything," said
Alva, "not an orthodox heaven. But I believe in an
endless existence for every atom existing in the universe,
and I believe that each atom determines the
successive steps of its own future, and so a brave little
pine-tree fills me with just as sincere admiration as
any other species of bravery. 'Next time'! It will
have a beautiful 'next time' in the heaven which
means something so different from what we are
taught, or here again on earth, or wherever its little
growing spirit takes form again. I'm not wise
enough to understand much of that, but I'm wise
enough to know that there is a next time of so
much infinitely greater importance than this time,
that this time is really only of any importance at
all in comparison just according to how we use it in
preparation. That's part of the lesson that the tree
teaches. But you can't understand me, Lassie, unless
you are able to grasp my belief&mdash;my fixed conviction&mdash;that
this world is only an instant in eternity. I
couldn't live at all unless I had this belief and hope,
and it's the key to everything with me; so please&mdash;please&mdash;give
me credit for sincerity, at least."</p>

<p>Lassie looked thoroughly awed. "I'll try to see
everything just as you do," she said.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>Alva pressed her hand. "Thank you, dear."</p>

<p>Then they went on up the road.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of hammer and saw was heard,
and the smell of wet plaster and burning rubbish came
through the trees.</p>

<p>"Is it from your house?" Lassie asked, with her
usual visible relief at the approach of the understandable.</p>

<p>"Yes, from my house," Alva answered. "They are
very much occupied with my house; fancy buying a
dear, old, dilapidated dwelling in the wilderness, and
having to make it new and warm and bright and cheerful
in a fortnight! Why, the tale of these two weeks
will go down through all the future history of the country,
I know. Such a fairy tale was never before. I
shall become the Legend of Ledge, I feel sure."</p>

<p>The road, turning here, ended sharply in a large, solid,
wooden gate, set deep in a thick hedge of pine trees.</p>

<p>"It is like a fairy tale!" Lassie cried delightedly;
"a regular Tourangean <i>porte</i> with a <i>guichet</i>!"</p>

<p>"It is better than any fairy tale," said Alva; "it
is Paradise, the lovely, simple-minded, Bible-story
Paradise, descending upon earth for a little while." She
pushed one half of the great gate-door open, and they
went through.</p>

<p>A small, old-fashioned, Colonial dwelling rose up
before them in the midst of dire disorder. Shingling,
painting, glass-setting, and the like were all going
forward at once. Workmen were everywhere; wagons
loading and unloading were drawn up at the side;
mysterious boxes, bales and bundles lay about; confusion
reigned rampant.</p>

<p>"Not exactly evolution, but rather revolution,"<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
laughed Alva, ceasing transcendentalism with great
abruptness, and becoming blithely gay. "And oh,
Lassie, the joy of it, the downright childish fun of it!
Don't you see that I couldn't be alone through these
days; they are too grand to be selfish over. I had
to have some one to share my fun. We'll come here and
help every day after this; the pantries will be ready
soon, and you and I will do every bit of the putting
them in order. Screw up the little hooks for the cups,
you know, and arrange the shelves, and oh, won't we
have a good time?"</p>

<p>Lassie's eyes danced. "I just love that kind of
work," she said, fully conscious of the pleasant return
to earth, "I can fit paper in drawers beautifully."</p>

<p>"Which proves that after all women stay women in
spite of many modern encouragements to be men," Alva
said. "You know really I'm considered to be most
advanced, and people look upon me as quite intellectual;
but I'm fairly wild over thinking how we'll scrub the
pantries, and put in the china&mdash;and then there's a
fine linen-closet, too. We'll set that in order afterwards,
and put all the little piles straight on the shelves."</p>

<p>By this time they had gone up the plank that bridged
over the present hiatus between ground and porch, and
entered the living-room, which was being papered in
red with a green dado and ceiling.</p>

<p>"How pretty and bright!" Lassie exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's going to be furnished in the same red and
green, with little book-shelves all around and the dining
table in the middle," Alva explained. "Oh, I do love
this room. It's my ideal sitting-room. It has to be the
dining-room, too, but I don't mind that."</p>

<p>"Won't the table have to be very small?"<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>"Just big enough for two."</p>

<p>"But when you have company?"</p>

<p>"We shall never have any company."</p>

<p>"I mean when you have friends with you here."</p>

<p>"I shall never have any friends with me, dear."</p>

<p>"Alva! Why&mdash;I can come&mdash;can't I?&mdash;Sometime?"</p>

<p>Alva shook her head.</p>

<p>"That's part of the story, Lassie, part of the story
that I am going to tell you in a few minutes now. But
be a little patient, dear; give me a few minutes more.
Come in here first; see&mdash;this was the dining-room,
but it has been changed into&mdash;I don't know what.
A sort of bedroom, I suppose one would call it. I've
had it done in blue, with little green vines and birds
and bees and butterflies painted around it. Birds and
bees and butterflies are always so lively and bright, so
busy and cheerful. All the pictures here are going to
be of animals, either out in the wild, free forest or else
in warm, sunshiny farmyards. I have a lovely print
of Wouverman's 'Im Stall' to hang in the big space.
You know the picture, don't you?&mdash;the shadowy
barn-room with one whole side open, and the hay
dripping from above, and the horses just ridden in,
and the chickens scratching, and some little children
playing in the corner by the well. It's such a sweet
<i>gemuthliche</i> picture&mdash;so full of fresh country air&mdash;I
felt that it was the picture of all others to hang in this
room. There will be a big sofa-bed at one side, and my
piano, and pots of blooming flowers. And you can't
think, little Lassie, of all that I look forward to accomplishing
in this room. I expect to learn to be a very
different woman, every atom and fibre of my being will<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
be altered here. All of my faults will be atoned for&mdash;"
she stopped abruptly, and Lassie turned quickly with
an odd impression that her voice had broken in
tears.</p>

<p>"Alva!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's nothing, dear, only that side of me that keeps
forgetting the lesson of the tree. Don't mind me,&mdash;I
am so happy that you must not mind anything nor
must I mind anything either; but&mdash;when I come into
this room and think&mdash;" her tone suddenly turned
dark, full of quivering emotion, and she put her hand
to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Alva, tell me what you mean? I feel frightened,&mdash;I
must know what's back of it all now. Tell me. Tell
me!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you in just a minute, as soon as
I've shown you all over the house." She took her
handkerchief, pressed it to her eyes, made a great,
choking effort at self-control, and then managed to go
on speaking. "See," pushing open a door, "this is a
nice little dressing-room, isn't it? And then around
and through this narrow back hall comes the kitchen.
There is an up-stairs, but I've done nothing there
except make a room comfortable and pleasant for the
Japanese servant who will do the work, that is, all
that I don't do myself."</p>

<p>"Won't you want but one servant?"</p>

<p>"I think so. A man from outside will take the
extras, and really it's a very small house, dear. The
laundry will be sent out. Dear me, how I do enjoy
hearing that kind of speech from my own lips. 'The
laundry will be sent out!' That sounds so delightfully
commonplace, so sort of everyday and like other<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
people. I can't express to you what the commonplaces,
the little monotonies of ordinary lives, mean
to me here. You'll divine later, perhaps. But fancy
a married life where nothing is too trivial to be
glorified! That is how things will be with us."</p>

<p>"Are you so sure?" Lassie tried to smile and speak
archly. Tried very hard to do both, because an intangible
atmosphere of sorrow was beginning to press
heavily on her spirits.</p>

<p>"Very sure,&mdash;really, quite confident. You must
not think that, because I sob suddenly as I did just
now, I am ever weak or ever doubt myself or any one
else. I never doubt or waver. It is only that no matter
how hard one tries, one can hardly rise completely out
of the thrall of one existence into the freedom of another
at only a week's notice."</p>

<p>"Is that what you are trying to do?"</p>

<p>"Dear, I'm not only trying to do it, but the greater
part of the time I do do it. It's only very seldom that
my soul faints and the tears come. I am really happy!
You are not going to be able to comprehend how happy
I am. Every one who wants anything in this world
always wants it in such a narrow, finite way,&mdash;no one
can understand joy too limitless to be finite. The
difficulty is that occasionally I get blind myself, or else
in mercy God sometimes veils the splendor for a few
minutes. When I faint or struggle, it is just that my
soul is absent; you must not mind when you see me
suffer, for the suffering has no meaning. It's just a sort
of discipline,&mdash;it doesn't count." She smiled with
wonderful brightness into Lassie's troubled face, and
then, pushing open the outer door,&mdash;"You don't
quite see how it is, but be patient with yourself,<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
dearie; it will come. All things come to him who
waits."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't understand, not one bit," Lassie
cried, almost despairingly.</p>

<p>They were in the yard now; Alva looked at her and
took her hand within her own. "Come," she said,
"we'll go down through the woods to a certain lovely,
bright spot where the view is big and wide, and there
I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"I so want to know!"</p>

<p>"I know you do, dear, and I want to tell you, too.
I'm not purposely tormenting you, but there is no
one else to whom I can speak. And that human, sobbing
part of me needs companionship just as much
these days, as the merry, house-loving spirit, or the
beatifically blessed soul. Can't you see, dear, that with
all my affection for you, I dread telling you my story,
and the reason for that is that it will be too much for
you to comprehend at first, and that I know perfectly
well that it is going to shock and pain you." The last
words burst forth like a storm repressed.</p>

<p>"Shock and pain me!" Lassie opened mouth and
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, of a certainty."</p>

<p>They were in the woods, quite alone.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Lassie drew a little away; a common,
cruel suspicion flashed through her head. "Alva, is
it&mdash;is it that you do not mean to marry the man?"</p>

<p>Alva laughed then, not very loudly, but clearly and
sweetly. "No, Lassie, it isn't that. I am going to be
married in the regular way and, besides, I will tell you
in confidence that I fully believe that I have been married
to the same man hundreds of times before, and<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
shall be married to him countless times again. Does
that help you?"</p>

<p>"Alva!"</p>

<p>"There! I told you that you wouldn't understand,
and you don't."</p>

<p>"No, I certainly don't, when you talk like that."</p>

<p>"It's natural that you shouldn't, dear; but at the
end of the week you will, perhaps. We'll hope so,
any way. Oh, Lassie, how much we are both to live
and learn in the next week."</p>

<p>Lassie turned her eyes to the eyes of the other.</p>

<p>"It's queer, Alva; you talk as if you were crazy, but
I know you're not crazy, and yet I'm worried."</p>

<p>"You don't need to be worried,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll try not to be." She raised her sweet eyes to
her friend's face as she spoke, and her friend bent
and kissed her. "Don't keep me waiting much longer,"
she pleaded.</p>

<p>They were passing through the little, tree-grown way
which led out on the brow of the hill. All the wide,
radiant wonder of that October morning unrolled before
them there. For an instant Lassie stood entranced,
forgetting all else; and then:</p>

<p>"Tell me now!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Let us sit down here," Alva said, pointing to a
rough seat made out of a plank laid across two stumps.
They sat down side by side.</p>

<p>"Alva, it seems as if I cannot wait another minute;
I must know it all now. Tell me who he is, first; is it
some one that I know?"</p>

<p>Alva's eyes rested on the wide radiance beyond.</p>

<p>"You know of him, dear," she replied quietly.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"<span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>The woman laid her arm around the girl and
drew her close and kissed her gently. Then she whispered
two words in her ear.</p>

<p>With a scream, Lassie started to her feet. "Oh&mdash;no!&mdash;no!&mdash;<i>no!</i>"</p>

<p>Alva looked straight up at her where she stood there
above her and smiled, steadily.</p>

<p>"No, no,&mdash;it can't be! I didn't hear right."</p>

<p>"Yes, you heard quite right."</p>

<p>The girl's hands shook violently; tears came fast
pouring down her face. "But, Alva, he is&mdash;he
can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tears filled the other's eyes, too, at that, and stole
thickly out upon her cheeks. "I know, my dear child,
but didn't I tell you how to me&mdash;to us&mdash;this life is
only a small part of the whole?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;but&mdash;oh, it's too horrible!" She
sank down on the seat again and burst out sobbing.</p>

<p>"No, dear," Alva exclaimed, her voice suddenly
firm, "not horrible, just that highest summit of life of
which I spoke before&mdash;the point toward which I've
lived, the point from which I shall live ever afterwards,&mdash;my
point of infinite joy,&mdash;my all. For he is the
man I love&mdash;have always loved&mdash;shall always love.
Only, dear, don't you see?&mdash;he isn't a <i>man</i> as you
understand the word; the love isn't even <i>love</i> as you
understand love. It's all so different! So different!"</p>

<p>A long, keenly thrilling silence followed, broken
only by the sound of the younger girl's repressed
weeping.</p>

<p>It was one of those pauses during which men and
women forget that they are men and women, that the
world is the world, or that life is life. Every human<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
consideration loses weight, and one is stunned into
heaven or oblivion, according to his or her preparation
for such an entry to either state.</p>

<p>The two friends remained seated side by side, facing
the wonderful valley in all its rich beauty of varied
colorings; but neither saw valley or color, neither remembered
for a little what she was or where she was.
Alva, with her hands linked around her knees, was out
and away into another existence; Lassie, her eyes
deadened and darkened with a horror too acute for any
words to relieve, sat still beside her, and knew nothing
for the time being but a fearful throbbing in her temples&mdash;a
black cloud smothering her whole brain&mdash;and
tears.</p>

<p>It was Lassie who broke the silence at last, trying
hard to speak evenly. "But, Alva, I never knew ...
when did you learn to love him ... why&mdash;" her
voice died again just there, and she buried her face on
the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>Alva laid her hand upon the little hand that shook
under a fresh stress of emotion, and said gently, her
tone one of deepest pity: "Shall I tell you all about it?
Would you like to know the whole story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes,&mdash;so much."</p>

<p>"You'll try to be patient and give yourself time to
really see how things may be to one who is altogether
outside of your way of thinking, won't you, dear?
You won't pass judgment too quickly?"</p>

<p>"I'll try. Indeed, I will, as well as I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alva pressed the hand. "Dear little girl," she said,
very tenderly, "you see I look at even you with quite
different eyes from those with which the ordinary person
sees you. If you could only see things as I do,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
you'd see everything so much more clearly. How can
I put it all straight for you? When even my love for
you is not at all what any other gives you."</p>

<p>Lassie lifted up her head. "How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There are two Lassies to me, dear,&mdash;the pretty,
sweet-looking girl, and the Lassie who loves me. Most
people confuse the two, and think them one and the
same; I don't. No matter what happened to you, the
Lassie whom I love could never alter&mdash;she is unchangeable.
She is not subject to change; she doesn't
belong to this world; she cannot die. And just as I
feel about you, I feel about everybody. What I can
see and touch in those I love is what I love least in
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alva!" it was like a little moan&mdash;the girl's
voice.</p>

<p>"That is my earnest belief. Bodies and what they
suffer don't count. That has come to me bit by bit
under the pressure of these last years. But it has come
in its completest form in the end. I am entirely
satisfied as to the only truth in the universe being the
fact that only Truth is eternal. Please try to remember
all this, while you listen to my story; try not to forget
it. You will, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I'll try, but it isn't clear to me."</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose so&mdash;" Alva sighed&mdash;"but do
your best, my dear;" she paused a moment, then drew
the hand that she held close between her own two, and
went on slowly; "I must tell you first of all that I
have never seen him but three times in my life. Just
think&mdash;only three times!"</p>

<p>"Only three&mdash;" Lassie looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Only three times. And hardly any one knows that<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
I saw him even those times. No one knows to-day
that we love one another, or that we are to be married,
except the surgeons and nurses, who had to be told, of
course. It's a very great secret."</p>

<p>"Tell me how it all began, Alva."</p>

<p>"I don't know when I first heard his name. It
all began here, dear, five years ago. When I stopped
off for a few days to visit the Falls. I've always loved
this country, and from the time that I was born I've
always been here for a few days now and then. I
always had a queer feeling that something drew me
here. I have those queer feelings about things and
places and people, you know, and out there on the
bridge has always seemed to me a sort of pivot in my
life. Every time I go there, the clock seems to strike
some hour for me&mdash;" she stopped.</p>

<p>Lassie opened and shut her free hand with a sensation
of being very uneasy; the suspicion that Alva was
not quite sane just lightly crossed her mind. It certainly
was not sane to talk as she did.</p>

<p>"So I came here again, on my way home from New
York, just five years ago now. And he was here then,
staying at Ledge Park, and I saw him for the first time;
we met out there on the bridge;" she stopped for just a
second or so, then went steadily on. "I think I read
about him in the papers. I had learned to admire him
intensely&mdash;who could help it?&mdash;but of course I'd
never for one instant thought of loving him. He was
like a sort of a story-hero to me; he never seemed like
a man; I never thought of any woman's loving him.
He just seemed to be himself, all alone&mdash;always
alone. He had seemed quite above and apart from all
other men to me. He interested me; I wanted to learn<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
all that I could about him and his work, and I did learn
a great deal, but I'd never dreamed of meeting him
face to face, of really speaking to him, of having his
eyes really looking at me; he seemed altogether beyond
and away from my existence. As if he lived on another
world. And then I met him that evening on the bridge,
in just the simplest sort of way. Oh, it was very wonderful."</p>

<p>"Did you know him right off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he looked just like his picture; but then I
knew him in another way, too. I can't describe it;
it was all very&mdash;very strange. It doesn't seem strange
to me now, but it would seem almost too strange to
you."</p>

<p>"Won't you try to tell me?"</p>

<p>"I will some day, dear, perhaps. I can't tell you
now, I couldn't explain it all to you; but, anyway, we
met and I looked at him and he looked at me&mdash;" she
pressed the hand within her own yet closer, adding
simply, "I believe that love&mdash;real love&mdash;comes like
that, first of all that one look, and then all the past
rushes in and makes the bridge to all the future. Oh,
Lassie," her voice sank to a whisper, "when I think
of that meeting and of all that it brought me, I am so
happy that I want to take the whole wide world into my
confidence, and beg every one not to play at love or to
take Love's name in vain; but to be patient, and wait,
and starve, or beg, or endure anything, just so as to
merit the joy which may perhaps be going to be. I
never had thought of what love might be; at least I
had never been conscious of such thinking. My life
all these years had been bound so straitly and narrowly
there at home. How could I think of anything that<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
would take me from those duties! And yet I see now
that it was all preparation, all the getting ready. If I
had only known it, though,&mdash;if I had only known it
then! It would all have been so much easier."</p>

<p>The whisper died away; she sat quite still looking
out over the hills. Lassie's eyes gazed anxiously upon
her; nothing in her own spirit tuned to this key; instead,
flashes of recollection kept lighting up the present with
forgotten paragraphs out of the newspaper accounts of
the accident. She shivered suddenly.</p>

<p>Alva did not notice. After a while she went on again.</p>

<p>"Some day you'll learn to love some one, and then
you'll know something of what I feel. I don't want
you to suffer enough to know all that I feel. But,
believe me, whatever one suffers, love is worth it. In
that first instant I learned&mdash;that first look showed
me&mdash;that it can mean all, everything, more even than
happiness itself; oh, yes, a great, great deal more than
happiness itself. In one way they're not synonymous at
all, love and happiness. I have been happy without love
all my life, and now I shall love without being what
the world calls 'happy'; but I <i>shall</i> be happy&mdash;happy
in my own way, just as I am happy now in something
that makes you tremble only to think of."</p>

<p>She paused; her eyelids fell over her eyes and the
lashes quivered where they lay on her cheeks, but her
hand continued to hold Lassie's, warm and close.
There was another long pause. And then another
sigh.</p>

<p>"So in that first hour&mdash;it was only one hour&mdash;I
learned the beginning of life's biggest lesson&mdash;what
life may be, what love may be, and also what for me
could never be. For just as soon as I really saw him,<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
I saw why he had remained alone. It was perfectly
plain to me. It was that he didn't live for himself; he
lived to carry out his purpose. One reads of such people,
but I never had met any one who was unable to see
himself in his own life before. It was a tremendous
lesson to me. It was like opening a door and looking
suddenly out upon a new order of universe. Everything
whirled for the first minutes, and then I saw that
my own life had been sufficiently unselfish to have
made me capable of comprehending his. It rose like
a flood through my soul, that everything has a reason,
and that my blind, stupid, hopeless years there at
home had all been leading straight up to that minute.
It was such a revelation, and such a new light on all
things. I was born anew, myself; I have never been
the same woman since. Never, never!"</p>

<p>Lassie's brows drew together; the revelation did not
appeal to her personal reason as reasonable.</p>

<p>"We talked for quite a while&mdash;not about ourselves&mdash;we
understood each other too well to need do that.
It seems to me now that we were almost one then, but
I didn't know it. All I knew was that I could measure
a little of what he was, and that there was a bond
between us of absolute content in working out God's
will rather than our own. I believe now that that is
really the only true love or the only true basis for any
marriage, and that when that mutual bond is once
accepted, nothing can alter, not even an ocean rolling
between&mdash;not even ten oceans. He spoke of the Falls,
and he spoke of his own work. I listened and thanked
God that I knew what he meant, and comprehended
what it meant to me. At the end of the hour we parted,
and I came back to the hotel and started for home the<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
morning after.... He went away, too, and it was
later&mdash;when we began to write letters&mdash;that our life
together, our beautiful ideal life together, began. You
can't realize its happiness any more than you can
measure all that my words really mean. I can't explain
myself any better, either. After a while it will
all come to you, I hope. I went on with the work at
home, and he continued his labors which allowed him
neither home nor family. Nobody knew and nobody
would have known, even if he or she thought that they
knew. The very best and loveliest things lie all around
the most of us, and the best and loveliest of all treasures
are within our own hearts&mdash;and yet very few
of us know anything about them. Perhaps better
that the world in general shouldn't understand the
joy of my kind of love, anyhow; it isn't time for
that yet."</p>

<p>"How, Alva?"</p>

<p>She smiled almost whimsically, "Dearest, as soon
as the whole world understands that sort of life, its
own mission will be fulfilled, and then there will be no
more of this particular world. You see!"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"So then, dear, time went on and on, and I was
happy, very happy. And he was very happy, also.
There was something truly childlike in his happiness;
he had never expected love in his life, because he had
never thought of meeting any one who would be able to
adapt herself to his circumstances. We never met,
because it didn't seem best or wise. We just loved,
and I don't believe that any two people have ever been
happier together than we were, apart, for these five
years&mdash;these happy, happy five years."<span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>Lassie felt a deepening misery; the last horrible
part must be going to come now.</p>

<p>Alva passed her hand over her eyes and drew a long
breath.</p>

<p>"It's so difficult to be different from other people,
and then to bear their way of looking at things. It's
so hopeless to try to translate one's feeling into their
language all the time. How can I go on, when I know
just how it all looks to you. It's fearfully hard for me."</p>

<p>"I won't say a word,"&mdash;the girl's cry was pitiful.</p>

<p>Alva threw both arms quickly about her and held her
close. "Bless you, darling, I know it. But you'll
suffer and I know that, too; and I feel your suffering
more than you guess. I know just how it all seems to
you. There is that within me which shudders too,
sometimes, and would shrink and weep only for the
strong, divine power that fills me with something better
than I can describe, something big enough and high
enough to fight down the coward. You have that same
divinity within you, dear, and you can't tell when or
where it will be called out, but once it is called out, you
never will be weak in the face of this earth's woes."</p>

<p>Lassie was weeping softly again.</p>

<p>"One morning&mdash;you know when&mdash;I opened the
paper to read it to papa after breakfast, and I saw on
the first page, across the top in bright red letters, that
he had been killed."</p>

<p>There was a little sharp cry&mdash;"But he wasn't?"&mdash;and
then a great sob.</p>

<p>"No, dear, but that was the first report."</p>

<p>"And you thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I believed it. But, Lassie, try to
calm yourself&mdash;because it wasn't to me what you<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
think. I was calm; I had learned so much, he had
taught me so much, during the five years, that I astonished
myself with my strength; really, I did. I went
about all that day just as usual, only thinking with a
white sort of numbness how long the rest of life would
seem; and then, in the evening, the paper said that he
was still alive. Then I telegraphed and the next day I
went to him. I knew that I must go to him and see
him once more, so I arranged things and went. I was
surprised all the journey at my own courage; it was
like a miracle, my power over myself. It was a long
journey, but I knew that I should see him again at the
end. I knew that he would not leave me without saying
good-bye, now that he was conscious that he was going.
I was sure of that. So confident can love and strength
be in love and strength.</p>

<p>"I arrived&mdash;I went to the hospital&mdash;they had the
room darkened because&mdash;well, you can guess. I
went to where the bed stood and knelt down beside
him, and laid my hand on his bosom. I felt his heart
beating&mdash;ever so faintly, but still beating,&mdash;and I
heard his voice. Only think, I had not heard his voice
for five years! To you or to any one else it might have
all been frightful, because, of course, the reality was
frightful. The man, as you understand men, was
mangled and dying, and could not possibly be with me
except for a few brief days. But, oh, my dearest,&mdash;with
me it was so different; it was all so absolutely
different. The man that <i>I</i> loved was unhurt, and the
evil chance had only made us nearer and dearer forever.
I don't say that I was not trembling, and that I was
not almost unnerved by the shock; but I can say, too,
and say truly, that the Something Divine which had<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
filled me from the first day, filled and upheld me and
made me know that all was good even then, even in
that dark hour and in that dark room, where he whom
I held dearest on earth was chained to pain beneath my
hand. The nurses were very kind. They left me there
beside him while he was conscious and unconscious
for some hours. They saw very quickly that it was
different with us from most people; and when I went
out two of the surgeons took me into a room alone
and told me the truth.</p>

<p>"I think that then was the greatest moment of my
life&mdash;when I comprehended that one who was not
killed outright by such a shock might live even months
until&mdash;until&mdash;Well, if a man so injured has vitality
enough to live at all, he may&mdash;live&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't go on, Alva, please,&mdash;I don't want to know
how long he may live."</p>

<p>"No, dear, I won't go into that. Only you must
think that to me it was such unexpected heaven.
Instead of death, he was alive. Instead of separation
for this life, we were to have some days of absolute
companionship. It was something so much more than
I had ever thought of hoping. A life&mdash;even for a day&mdash;together!
Companionship! Not letters, but words.
I to be his nurse, his solace, to have him for my own.
I stayed awake all night thinking. I knew what being
swept suddenly away meant to him. I knew of his
life plans, and what made death hardest to him. It
came to me that I might ease that bitterness. That
his need could go forth through the medium of my love
and interest. That his work would pass on into other
hands through mine. That all the golden web of Fate
had been woven directly to this end."<span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>Lassie continued sobbing.</p>

<p>"I saw what we could do. In the morning I went
to the surgeons, and they said that each day added a
week of possible life, and that although it would be
many days before anything could be done, after that,
he could be moved and wait for the end&mdash;with me.
I went to him then, and again I knelt there by the bed,
and this time I told him how I was going to spend the
weeks, and what he must look forward to. He was
unable to talk, but he looked at me and&mdash;like the
first time&mdash;we understood one another absolutely.
He accepted the happiness that was to be as gratefully
as I did myself. As I said before, it was so much more&mdash;so
much more&mdash;than we had ever expected!
He took up his burden of agony as cheerfully and
courageously as he had taken everything in life, and I
came away. There was no use in my remaining there,
as he would be either unconscious or&mdash;I could not
remain there; the surgeons forbade it.</p>

<p>"Then I had to find a place quickly, a place where
no one would come or would see. A place where he and
I could share life and God, who is Life, without any
outsiders breaking in to stare and wonder."</p>

<p>Her voice suddenly became broken and hurried.
"Of course I thought of Ledge, where we had first
met, and I wrote to Ronald at once. He found me that
dear little nest back there, and&mdash;" she stopped, for
Lassie had suddenly started to her feet. "What is it,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't bear it at all. To me it is horrible&mdash;horrible!
Why, he can never stand up again&mdash;he&mdash;Oh,
I want to be alone. I must be alone. I'll&mdash;I'll
come back&mdash;in time&mdash;"<span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>She did not wait to finish; she gave one low, bitter
cry, and wrung her hands. Then she ran down the
steep, little path that led to Ledgeville, leaving her
friend on the hilltop, with the October sun pouring its
splendor all about her.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h3">THAT DISPASSIONATE OBSERVER, MRS. RAY</p>

<p>THERE never was the human tragedy, comedy,
or melodrama, yet, which did not have one or
more dispassionate observers. This is strictly true
because, even if a man goes off into the wilderness to
fight his fight out utterly alone, there are moments
when one part of his own spirit will dissever itself
from all the rest and, standing forth, tell him of his
progress or retrogression with a pitiless, unbiassed
truth. The wilderness is advisable for that very
reason, but no one makes a greater mistake than when
he or she goes to a small far-away village and pleasantly
terms it "the wilderness," supposing soul-solitude an
integral part thereof. It is very right, proper, and conventional
to view life from one's own standpoint, but
the real facts of the case are old and trite enough to
warrant me in repeating the statement that all doings
in this world have their dispassionate observer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray was the natural observer for the town of
Ledge. The town was not quite aware that added to
her keen powers of observation she was also the Voice
of the community. People never expressed themselves
fully, without first knowing what she said. Public
opinion simmered all over the township, so to speak,
and then finally boiled over in Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>It will be quite impossible to impress upon the<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
ordinary reader the importance of such Public Opinion,
unless a few paragraphs are devoted to the town of
Ledge and its history. If one fails to properly appreciate
the town of Ledge, the tale might just as
well have been located in North Ledge, South
Ledge, Ledgeville, Ledge Centre, or any of the other
Ledges.</p>

<p>Therefore on behalf of the lovely little hamlet of
Ledge itself, I will state in as few words as possible
that it lies upon a hill overlooking one of the most
beautiful and picturesque scenes in all Northeastern
America; that it took its name and being from a great
and noble-hearted man, who, passing that way by
chance, half a century since, paused near its site to
sadly contemplate the denuded banks of the little river
winding its way amidst the d&eacute;bris and desolation left
by the lumber barons of the period. Time was when
the same banks had been smiling terraces covered thick
with primeval pines, but "civilization" had demanded
their downfall and they fell. Fell without warning,
and also without discretion. Fell forever, flinging the
riches of all the future aside for the plenty of one man's
day. Blackened stumps, great beds of unsightly chips,
waste which would never have been called waste in any
other land, ruthless destruction,&mdash;all this disfigured
the landscape that stretched before that visitor of fifty
years ago. His heart was heavy, for he was one who
loved everything good, and trees and beauty are two of
man's best gifts from above; but while he gazed over
what to him and many others was almost as much desecration
as desolation, he saw, forever flowing&mdash;however
choked&mdash;the little river below. Like the thread of
idealism which illuminates the most despairing situation,<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
so flowed the silvery stream down through the scene
before him. Its bed was clogged with drift, its banks
covered with rotting rubbish, yet the promise of its
beauty remained; and then and there the traveller
formulated a plan for its redemption to the end that
unborn generations might revel in the realization of
that of which he alone seemed then conscious.</p>

<p>The town of Ledge was a part of what resulted.
There had to be a town, and Ledge came into existence.
Where there is work to be done, come the workers, and
with them come towns. Ledge came and grew. To
the call of prosperity many other Ledges gathered a
little later; but they never enjoyed the dignity of the
one and original. The first Ledge was tenacious of
its priority. It held to its privileges as rigidly as any
medieval knight held to his. Castled upon the hill
above, it simulated power in more ways than one. For
many years all the others had to go to Ledge for their
mail. Ledge also owned the sheriff, the blacksmith,
and the lawyer, and kept a monopoly on the summer
excursionist; the express office was its natural perquisite;
a bend of the canal took it in, and when the
canal went the railroad came to console the losers.
Mr. Ledge's plans, which had turned his private estate
into a public park for the gently disposed, also held
Ledge in high honor. To visit Ledge Park from any of
the other Ledges was rendered well-nigh impossible.
The little town stood like a sentinel at the end of the
Long Bridge, and at the top of the First Fall. Every
picnicker had to go through it, had to check such
articles as could not conveniently be carried all day, in
its hotel; had to get whatever he might feel disposed
to drink in the same place. During the summer,<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
visitors were so plenteous that it became the fashion
in Ledge to despise them, and that right heartily,
too. The people who brought the town most of
its means of livelihood received much that species
of sentiment with which an irritating husband and
father is frequently viewed. It was the fashion in
Ledge to despise city people and their ways in all
things; even their coming to see the Falls was referred
to as special proof of their singularly feeble minds,
while the way in which the visitors climbed and walked
was the favorite topic of mirthful criticism, all summer
long. Criticism is a strange habit. It is contagious,
thrives in any soil or no soil at all, and is far more
destructive to him or her who gives it birth than it can
possibly be to any other person. Not that it really is
destructive, but that the weight of criticism rarely falls
where it is supposed to be most needed.</p>

<p>The summer visitors evoked so much comment between
May and November that a great longing to have
something to talk about between November and May
followed. It therefore became the fashion in Ledge to
talk of everything and everybody, and as the summer
visitors were rated low, the rest of the world was pretty
freely given over to the same cataloguing. It was
usual to rate Ledgeville and all the other Ledges particularly
low, and this opinion held firm, until a biting
edge was given it by a second railroad which came
down the valley's bottom to the unspeakable wrath of
the hills on either side and of Ledge in special. It
took several years to assimilate the second railroad, and
resume the even tenor of life. But the adjustment was
finally made, and at the date of this story Ledge
was a wee country idyll set like a pearl amidst the<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
beautiful environment of that fairest of country counties.
He who was responsible for town and environment
lived on his own estate near by, and came in for
his share of consideration from the tongues of his
namesake. The great philanthropist was busily engaged
in his battle to preserve intact, for the good of
the many to come, that matchless picture with its open
Bible of Nature's Own History. Of the picture and its
practical value, Ledge had its own opinion. It had its
own opinion of the dam, too. It had its own opinion
of Alva. And of Lassie. And of Ingram. And all
these opinions flowed freely forth through the medium
of Mrs. Ray. As that lady herself put it: "Whether
I'm picking chickens or digging fence-posts, or carting
the United States mail down to the train in the wheelbarrow
that I had to buy and the United States Government
won't pay for,&mdash;I never am idle; I'm always
taking in something."</p>

<p>And it was quite true. Whatever Mrs. Ray was
working at, her brain was never idle; it was always
absorbing something. It was not uncommon to see a
neighbor walking with her while she ploughed, conversation
going briskly on meanwhile. She swept the
church with company, and she almost never sat alone
between mail times. It was a full, busy life, and an
interesting one. It was full of importance and responsibility,
too. Mrs. Ray liked to be responsible and was
naturally important. Her opinions were in the main
correct, but sometimes she did draw wrong conclusions.
For instance, when she looked down the road the morning
after Lassie's arrival, and saw the two friends
departing over the Long Bridge.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she said to whoever was near by at the<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
minute, "I smell trouble for that oldest one if she's
planning to keep that pretty girl here long. That man
is going to fall in love with that pretty girl. He never
has cared much for her, anyway. He don't even seem to
like to go over to their house with her; she goes alone
mostly. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>The somebody sitting near by at the minute was
Mrs. Dunstall. And Pinkie, of course. They had
dropped in to see if they had any mail, and had found
Mrs. Ray cutting the hair of the three youngest children
left her, first by her predecessor and then by Mr. Ray
himself.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she had said cordially; "the second
train isn't in yet, and it's got to come in and go out and
let the mail-train come in, even if the mail ain't late,
on account of the wreck."</p>

<p>"Oh, is there a wreck?" Mrs. Dunstall asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes. Forty-four run into a open switch up at
Cornell. If the switch is open, I never see why the
train don't just run on out the other end and keep right
along; but all the accidents is as often open switches
as anything, so I guess there's a reason. At any rate,
the wrecking-train's gone up and the second mail's
going to be late. Tip your head a little, Billy. Yes,
indeed."</p>

<p>"I wonder if we'd better wait," said Mrs. Dunstall,
unwrapping her shawl somewhat and taking a chair.
"What do you say, Pinkie?"</p>

<p>Pinkie was already seated. She weighed two hundred
pounds and never stood up when she could help
it. "I say 'Wait,'" said Pinkie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunstall thereupon sat down, too, and after<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
ten minutes of a most solemn silence Mrs. Ray finished
her task and dismissed the children. She faced her
callers, then, folding her little gray shoulder-wrap
tightly across her bosom as she did so, and tucking the
ends in close beneath her armpits. The little gray
shawl was one of the first signs of winter in Ledge;
Mrs. Ray always donned it at the beginning of October,
and never took it off before the last day of May.</p>

<p>"Well!" she said now; "anything new come up?"</p>

<p>"Millicent come on the same train with that girl,"
Mrs. Dunstall began at once. "I wasn't really expecting
any mail this morning, but I thought I might as
well come down about now and tell you how Millicent
come on the train with her. You know who I mean, of
course?"</p>

<p>"She knows," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"I s'posed you would. And so Millicent come on
the same train with her. Seems too curious of Millicent
coming on the same train with her, when Millicent
hasn't been on a train but twice in her life before, and
then to think that she would come back with that girl.
Things do fall out queer in this world. She sit right
in the seat behind her, too. That was awful curious,
I think."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray gave the ends of her shawl a fresh tuck,
and drew in some extra breath.</p>

<p>"You never can tell," she began; "things do come
about mighty strange in this world. Yes, indeed. It's
the unexpected that has happened so much that it's
got to be a proverb in the end. I always feel when a
thing has been coming about till it gets to be proverb,
it's no use me disputing it. Dig around in smoking
ashes long enough, and I've never failed to find some<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
sparks yet. And what you just said is all true as true
can be. It's the unexpected as always happens. Look
at me, for instance. Look at how the post-office fell
out of a clear sky on me, and Mr. Ray much the same,
too. I never had any idea of either of 'em beforehand,
and now here I am stamping letters morning and night
to keep up the payments on his tombstone. Things do
work in circles so in this world. I always say if I hadn't
been postmistress no one would have expected to see
my husband have a fringed cloth hang on a pillar over
his dead body, and if I hadn't been postmistress I
never could have paid for such a thing. But where
there's a will there's a way, which is another proverb
as I've never found go wrong, unless your way is to
stay in bed while you're willing."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you never could have put anything plain
on Mr. Ray&mdash;not in your circumstances, and him
passing the plate every Sunday and you the sexton
yourself." Mrs. Dunstall looked almost shocked at
the mere fancy.</p>

<p>"Couldn't I! Well, I guess I could if I'd had my
own way. But I wasn't allowed my own way. Nobody
is. That's what holds us back in this world; it's
the being expected to live up to what we've got; and in
this country, where the garden is open to the public,
most of us has to live up to a good deal more'n we've
got. If America ever takes to walls, it'll show it's going
to begin to economize. It'll mean we're giving up
tulips and going in for potatoes. And you'll see, Mrs.
Dunstall, that just as soon as we really have to economize
we'll begin to build walls. There's something
about economy as likes walls around the house&mdash;high
ones."<span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>"You was raised with walls, wasn't you?" said
Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>"I should think I was. I'm English-born&mdash;I am."</p>

<p>"How old was you when you come to this country,
Mrs. Ray?"</p>

<p>"I've lived here thirty-eight years; that's how old I
was."</p>

<p>"You wasn't here before Mr. Ledge?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't, nor before the Falls, neither."</p>

<p>"Why, the Falls was here before Mr. Ledge," said
Mrs. Dunstall, enlarging her eyes. "Oh, I see, you're
making a joke, Mrs. Ray."</p>

<p>"I do occasionally make a joke," said Mrs. Ray,
giving her shawl another tuck.</p>

<p>"Well, to go back to the girl," said Mrs. Dunstall,
"she sit right behind Millicent too, and what makes it
all the stranger, is, she asked Millicent the name of the
next station. Millicent told her it was going to be
Ledge, and asked her if she was for Ledge, because if
she was for East Ledge she ought to stay on one station
more. You know, Mrs. Ray, how folks are always getting
off here for East Ledge, and having to stay all
night or hire a buggy to drive over&mdash;two shillings
either way; and Millicent asked her, too, if she was
for Ledge's Crossing, because if she was for the Crossing
the train don't stop there, and Millicent always was
kind-hearted and wanted her to know it right off. You
know how Millicent is, Pinkie; the last time she rode on
a train she threw the two bags off to the old lady who
forgot them, and they weren't the old lady's bags; they
were the conductor's, and he had to run the train way
back for them; he did feel so vexed about them,
Millicent said."<span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>"So vexed," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"And so then Millicent asked her if maybe she was
for Ledgeville, because if she was for Ledgeville she
was on the wrong train, and had ought to have took the
Pennsylvania, unless she telegraphed from Ledge
Centre for the omnibus to come up, which nobody ever
knows to do; and then it come into Millicent's head
as maybe she was going to visit Mr. Ledge, in which
case goodness knows what she would do, for although
he gets his mail at Ledge, he gets his company at Castile,
and here was that poor child five miles of bridge and
walk out of her way, and Millicent's heart just bleeding
for her, she looked so tired. But she said she was for
Ledge."</p>

<p>"Yes, I could have told you she was for Ledge,"
said Mrs. Ray; "there was two letters for her here.
When I have letters for people without having the
people for the letters, it always means one or two things,&mdash;either
the people are coming or the letters are
addressed wrong. I learned that long ago. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Millicent says she liked her looks from the first,"
pursued Mrs. Dunstall, "only her hat did amuse her.
I must say the hats folks from town wear is about the
most amusing things we ever see here. One year they
pin 'em to their fronts and next year to their backs, and
Millicent says this one was on hindside before with a
feather duster upside down on top. She never saw anything
like it; but she said the girl was so innocent of
what a sight she was that she wouldn't have let her see
her laughing behind her back for anything. What do
you think of city people anyhow, Mrs. Ray?"</p>

<p>"City people are always mooney," responded Mrs.
Ray; "such mooney ideas as come into their heads in<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
the country always. Seems like they save all their
mooney ideas for the country. Yes, indeed. They take
off their hats and their shoes and carry stones around in
their handkerchiefs; and when I see 'em slipping and
scrambling up and down that steep bank all the hot
summer long, and taking that walk to the Lower Falls
that's enough to kill any Christian with brains, I most
humbly thank our merciful Father in heaven that I've
stayed in the country and kept my good senses. Yes,
indeed. And then what they lug back to town with
them! That's what uses me all up! Roots and stones!
Why, I saw some one bring a root from the Lower Falls
last year, yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"That walk to the Lower Falls is terrible," said Mrs.
Dunstall, meditatively. "I took it once,&mdash;and you,
too,&mdash;didn't you, Pinkie?"</p>

<p>"Twice," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"I took it once, too," said Mrs. Ray, who was never
loath to discuss that famous promenade. "Mr. Ray
and me took it together. It was when we first met. He
took me, and we walked to the Lower Falls. It was a
awful walk; I never see a worse one, myself. They say
it isn't so bad now. Of course, the time I went with
Mr. Ray was while he was still alive. It was harder
then. He asked me to marry him coming back. Oh,
I'll never forget that awful walk!"</p>

<p>"It's bad enough yet," said Mrs. Dunstall. "Mr.
Ledge has done all he could to build things to catch
hold of where you'd go head over heels to heaven if he
hadn't, but it's a awful walk still. And then the steps!
Why, Nathan and Lizzie was there last summer, and
Lizzie says all the way down she was thinking how she
was ever going to be able to get back, and all the way<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
back she was thinking just the same thing. Going, you
go down steps till it seems like there never would come
the bottom, and coming back you come up steps till
you're ready to move to Ledgeville and live on the
bottoms for life. You know how that is, Pinkie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do any good to move to Ledgeville to
get rid of the Lower Falls," said Mrs. Ray, "because
the dam is going to do away with the Lower Falls and
drown Ledgeville entirely. That's the next little surprise
the city folks will be giving us."</p>

<p>"I shall like to stand on the bridge the day they let
the water in over the dam the first time," said Mrs.
Dunstall. "It'll be a great sight to see the valley turn
into a lake, and South Ledge and Ledgeville go under."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't look forward to it too much if I was you,"
said Mrs. Ray; "it's going to take three or four years
to dig that dam, they tell me. You can't lay out a lake
and break up three sets of falls in a minute."</p>

<p>"They haven't got to do something to all the Falls,"
said Mrs. Dunstall. "Josiah Bates was holding stakes
for one of the surveyors yesterday, and he heard him
say as the Lower Falls wouldn't need a thing, for it was
a mill-race already."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a blessing if there's one thing ready to
their hands," said Mrs. Ray, "for I must say the way
the State has took hold of us, since Mr. Ledge set out to
give it something for nothing, is a caution. If he'd
offered to sell the Falls at cost price, we'd of had a
petition and our taxes increased and been marked
'keep off the grass,' in all directions; but just because
he offered to give it to 'em all cleared up and in order,
they must tear around and build a dam and drown<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
five villages and go cutting up monkey-shines generally.
Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"They do say that the dam will keep the Falls,
instead of spoiling them," said Mrs. Dunstall; "they
say the Falls is stratifying backward, and is most
through being falls, anyway, and if the dam is built,
we'll all have that to look at always."</p>

<p>"It'll be all one to me," said Mrs. Ray; "I never get
time to look at nothing, anyway, unless it's folks waiting
for their mail, and goodness knows they've long ceased
to interest me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunstall looked a bit uncertain as to how to
receive this outburst of confidence. "It does you good
to take a little rest," she said at last; "you work too
hard for a woman of your time of life, Mrs. Ray."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to know how I can help it, with my
farm and my chickens and my grocery business, not
to speak of the boarders and the children and the post-office.
When one's a mother and a farmer and a sexton
and an employee under bond to the United States
Government one has to keep on the jump."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunstall rearranged the set of her lips slightly.
"The mail's very late, ain't it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Late! I should think it was late. I guess that
open switch has settled Forty-four for to-day. But
that train's always late. It isn't in the block yet, and
the mail-train follows it."</p>

<p>"If it don't come soon, I can't wait," said Mrs.
Dunstall; "this is one of my awful days, and speaking
of awful days, what do you think of the doings over at
the old Whittaker house, Mrs. Ray?"</p>

<p>"I've heard she's wrecking it completely."</p>

<p>"Josiah Bates' been doing some carting there. He<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
says it's enough to make old Grandma Whittaker
shiver in her grave. He says they've turned the house
just about inside out. That girl must be crazy."</p>

<p>"She is crazy," said Mrs. Ray with decision; "she's
in love."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Dunstall, "with him, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Of course. But she's crazy two ways, I think, to
go bringing that pretty girl here, and she so thin and
white herself. You can't tell me that that man doesn't
know a pretty girl when he sees her, even if he ain't
seen her yet&mdash;which he hasn't, for he didn't see 'em
this morning. I know that, for I was watching."</p>

<p>"That's the train now, isn't it?" said Mrs. Dunstall,
listening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray pricked up her ears. "Yes, that's the
train, rushing along and sprinkling soot over everything.
Picking hops used to be such nice clean work,
but now they're all over soot."</p>

<p>"The canal was better, I think," said Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray made no answer; she was absorbed in
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"It was cleaner, anyhow," Mrs. Dunstall continued;
"but they do say the men swore most awful locking
boats through in the night. I never lived on the canal,
myself, but you did, Pinkie; did they swear much or
not?"</p>

<p>"They swore," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Ray, now facing about and making
certain active preparations for the reception of the
mail, "it must be nice to spend your days ways
that lets you lay awake nights listening to anything
swear. I've never had time nor money to lay awake
nights. I leave that for those who can, but I can't.<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
Walking to the Lower Falls and laying awake nights is
pleasant, I've no doubt, but I need my days other ways.
Summer folks is always coming in here and saying,
'Oh, have you seen the gorge this morning, Mrs. Ray,'
and me like enough out ploughing in the opposite
direction since sun up. I haven't got any time to lay
awake or to look at views. If the weeds grew up all
around my fence-posts while I was hanging over the
bridge looking at the gorge, I guess you'd hear of it,
and since I've taken to raising chickens, there's hen-houses
to spray and me busier than ever. If I was a
hen, my day's work would be over when I'd laid my egg
and I could run out with a free mind and look at the
gorge, but as it stands now, I ain't got time to look at
nothing,"&mdash;in testimony whereof she disappeared
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you who's got time," said Mrs. Dunstall
as soon as she reappeared; "it's those Lathbuns down at
Nellie's. How long are they going to stay around here,
do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I don't know anything about them.
They don't get any mail, so I've no way of knowing a
thing. My own opinion is that if I was Nellie I'd keep
a sharp eye on my shawls, for folks who come walking
along without baggage, can go walking off without
baggage, too. Those are her shawls they're wearing,
you know; they haven't got so much as a jacket
between them of their own."</p>

<p>"Nellie says they're very nice people," said Mrs.
Dunstall; "and the girl has got a love affair. She
don't mind their wearing her shawls."</p>

<p>"Why don't he write her, then," said Mrs. Ray;
"that's the time even the poorest letter-writer writes<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
letters. Mr. Ray wrote me the first Thursday after he
was in love. I've got the letter yet."</p>

<p>"What did he write you for, when you was keeping
house for him, anyway?" asked Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>"He was gone to Ledge Centre for the license."</p>

<p>"I never see why you married him," said Mrs.
Dunstall; "he paid you for keeping house for him before
that, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he had his mind set on marrying some one,
and I thought I'd better marry him than any one else.
And I was fond of the children, and I didn't know
nothing about the mortgages. I always say we was
real fashionable. I didn't know nothing about
the mortgages, and he thought I had some money
in the bank. Well, it was an even thing when
it all came out. I guess marriage generally is. Everything
else, too."</p>

<p>"I don't see why the mail don't come, if it's in," said
Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray went to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>"It'll come soon now," she declared, hopefully.</p>

<p>"But I can't wait any longer," said Mrs. Dunstall,
rising, "I wasn't expecting anything, anyway. Come,
Pinkie."</p>

<p>They both rose and started to go out together.</p>

<p>But just at the door they met one of the surveyors.</p>

<p>"Oh, that reminds me why I come," said Mrs.
Dunstall, stopping; "young man, do you know Sallie
Busby?"</p>

<p>The young surveyor looked startled.</p>

<p>"Chestnuts in a blue and white sunbonnet, mainly?"
said Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>"I don't recollect."<span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>"Well, you might not have noticed, or she might
not have had it on, but either way she's been most
amused watching your young men pegging those little
flags all through her meadow, but she says that when
you got through last night you forgot seven, and she
saw 'em when she went out to pick the two trees up
the cow-path this morning, and run down and got 'em,
and has 'em all laid by for you whenever you want to
send for 'em."</p>

<p>The young man stood speechless.</p>

<p>Finally he said: "But they were meant to be left
there."</p>

<p>"Were&mdash;were they?" said Mrs. Dunstall, in great
surprise; "well, you ought to have told her so then.
She saw you pull some up, so she thought you meant to
pull them all up. Too bad! Now you'll have to get
your machine and go peeking all over her land again,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"We will if she's pulled up the flags, certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, she's pulled up the flags. If Sallie set out to
pull them up, they'd up, you can count on that!
How's the dam coming on, anyway?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed. "Why, there's no question
of the dam yet. You all seem to think that we're here
to build it. We have to make a report to the commission
first, and the commission will lay the report before the
legislature. That's how it is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray folded her arms and joined in suddenly,
"So&mdash;that's how it is, is it? Well, I don't wonder it's
difficult to run a post-office, when anything as plain as
a dam has to be fussed over like that. By the way,
you're one of the surveyors and you ought to know,&mdash;is
it true that if they do build the dam, it may get a<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
little too full and run over into our valley or burst altogether
and drown Rochester? I'm interested to
know."</p>

<p>"That's what we want to know, too," said Ingram's
assistant; "that's what we're surveying for."</p>

<p>"How long will it take you to tell? I've got a friend&mdash;maybe
you know him, Sammy Adams?&mdash;and he
owns most of the valley back here. He's the worrying
kind, and he's worried. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't make so much difference about Rochester,"
said Mrs. Dunstall; "it's a deal easier to go for
our shopping to Buffalo from here; but wouldn't it be
awful for Sammy Adams! Why, his house is right in
the valley."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ray, "and as a general thing
Sammy's right in his house. It's bad enough now, with
the freshets scooping sand all over the farm every other
spring, but if the dam goes and scoops Sammy Adams,
the legislature'll have something else to settle besides
the Capitol at Albany. Sammy Adams looks meek, but
he'd never take being drowned quietly; he's got too
much spirit for that. Yes, indeed!"</p>

<p>"We're going to do away with the freshets, Mrs.
Ray," the young man said; "the dam&mdash;if it comes&mdash;will
be the biggest blessing that ever came this way, let
me tell you. In the summer you'll have a beautiful
lake to sail on, and no end of excursions."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought they were going to store up the
water in spring, and draw it off in the summer," said
Mrs. Dunstall. "A man told my husband that that
was what they wanted the dam for,&mdash;to save the high
water in the spring so as to use it in the summer. Wasn't
that what Ebenezer said, Pinkie?"<span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, it was," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"How do you explain that?" asked Mrs. Ray, turning
an inquisitorial eye sternly on the surveyor. "Where's
your beautiful lake going to be by July? Marsh and
mosquitoes, that's what we'll have left. Don't tell me;
I've seen too many kind thoughts about making folks
happy end that way, and I've seen one or two reservoirs,
too. The dam'll drown Sammy Adams,
that's what it'll do, and Ledge'll be left high and dry
with a lot of dead fish lying all over the fields. I know!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see!" said the young man, laughing.</p>

<p>"But I thought you was all for the dam, Mrs. Ray,"
said Mrs. Dunstall, a little surprised. "Whatever
has changed you so?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray shut her mouth tightly and then opened it
with a snap. "I've been thinking," she said abruptly;
"and I don't mind changing my opinion when I must.
Any one who wants to hold a position under the United
States Government has got to have brains and use 'em
freely in changing their opinion."</p>

<p>"But you said&mdash;" began Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>"What if I did? Like enough I'll say it again. I
will, if I feel like it. Yes, indeed. 'He moves in a
mysterious way,' you know, and I'm one of His ways,
and I've got a right to keep my own counsel about my
own work. But&mdash;speaking of work&mdash;the mail-train
was in before you come up. I wonder what's become
of the bag!" She went to the window and looked
down towards the station. "I do have such trouble
to get hold of that bag. That's one of the hardest
things about keeping a post-office, is the getting hold of
the bag. They don't have any sort of understanding
of what a United States Government position means,<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
down at our station; they kick the mail-bag around
like it was a crate of hens. Once they asked me if they
couldn't have the key at the station, and open the
mail because there's always more inhabitants in the
station than in the post-office. They seemed to think
that was a glory to the station, and a reflection on me.
But I don't want to have men sitting around here. I
won't have it. The only man who has any legal right
to sit around me is in heaven, and just because I'm the
postmistress is no reason why I should take chances.
If you don't want men sitting around, you can easily
keep 'em from doing it by having no chairs for them
to sit on. I never have."</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to go down and get the mail?"
suggested the young surveyor, somewhat uneasily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray turned a severe eye his way. "Have
you go down and get the mail! Well, young man,
I guess you don't know that it's a penitentiary
offence to lay hands on a mail-sack, unauthorized by
the United States Government! Yes, indeed. It is,
though, and I've had such hard work getting it into
people's heads that it is, that I wouldn't authorize no
one. <i>No one!</i> Why, when we first was a post-office,
I had the most awful time. Everybody coming this
way brought the bag with 'em. It's a penitentiary
offence to touch the bag, and here Sammy Adams forgot
he had it in his buggy one night, and drove home
with it. It was when Mrs. Allen's cousin Eliza was
dying, and she was so anxious, and no mail-bag at all
that night. I tell you I took a firm stand after that; I
made the rule and made it for keeps, that no matter if
there wasn't but one postal, and all the men in the
station had felt the bag to see that there wasn't, the<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
bag must come up to me just the same. You'll find,
young man, that if you hold a United States Government
position, you'll be expected to uphold the United
States Government, and if you're building the dam and
employ the men around here, you'll find that to impress
them you must keep a bold front. That's why
I have my arms folded most of the time."</p>

<p>The young surveyor listened with reverent attention.</p>

<p>"Whose business is it to bring the bag, anyway?"
asked Mrs. Dunstall. "I can't wait much longer."</p>

<p>"It isn't anybody's business,&mdash;that's what's the
trouble. The United States Government don't provide
nothing but penalties for touching the mail-bag. That's
another hard thing about holding a government position
when your hands are as full as mine. At first I couldn't
get the mail-bag respected, in fact they used it to keep
the door to the station open windy days; and then,
when I got it respected by explaining what we was liable
to if we didn't respect it, I couldn't get no one to touch
it any more. I had to wheel it up and down in the
baby-carriage for a while, and then I looked up the
law and found I could delegate my authority; so since
then Mr. Hopkins has delegated for me except when he
goes to Ledge Lake, and when he does that I take it in
a wheelbarrow. I give the baby-carriage to Lucy.
She had that baby, you know. Well, of course a baby
needs a carriage, so I give her ours."</p>

<p>"A baby's lots of trouble," said Mrs. Dunstall,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're here for trouble," said Mrs. Ray,
cheerfully. "I've got the post-office, Lucy's got the
baby, and poor Clay Wright Benton's got his mother
and the parrot. Everybody's got something!"<span class="pagenum">[89]</span></p>

<p>"Well, I can't wait any longer," said Mrs. Dunstall;
"good-bye. Come, Pinkie."</p>

<p>They went out.</p>

<p>"Who is Pinkie?" the young man asked, when he
was alone with Mrs. Ray. "I d'n know," said Mrs.
Ray, "she don't, either. They adopted her when she
weighed six pounds and named her Pinkie, and that's
what come of it."</p>

<p>"I see." Just then the mail-bag was brought in.<span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h3">WHEN DIFFERENCES LEAD TO WHAT IS EVER THE SAME</p>

<p>Lassie fled down the path. Not even that
primeval river which once rushed wildly across
the old Devonian rocks just here was more thoughtless
as to whither it was going. All that she
was conscious of in that instant was irresistible
revolt against the horror of what she had just
heard, and which bred in her a sudden and utter
rebellion. A vivid imagination will have already
pictured the possible effect of Alva's story upon
her friend, and that vast majority whose imaginations
are not vivid will be happy to be spared
such details. It is sufficient to say that tears, pain,
groans, and a coffin suspended, like Damocles' sword,
above all the rest, was Lassie's background to her
friend's romance; and the picture thus held in her
mind was so benumbing to her other senses that as she
ran she tripped, stumbled, almost fell, down the hill,
so blind and careless of all else had she become. The
restraint of Alva's presence was now removed; nothing
stood between the young girl and her sensation of
appalling wretchedness. As she ran she shook, she
shuddered; the path was steep, and her knees
seemed to crumble beneath her; twice she almost
went headlong, and at the minute she felt that a<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
broken neck was but a trifle in comparison to
coming face to face with anything like what she had
just been told. "Of course he was a great man," she
gasped half aloud; "but he'll never be able to even
feed himself again&mdash;it said so in the paper. Why, at
first it said his back was broken. Oh, oh, if Alva can
be so crazy as that, who is sane, and what can one
believe? Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear! And she
calls it love, too!"</p>

<p>The village of Ledgeville lay below, and a few more
minutes of precipitous flight brought Lassie in sight
of its houses. Still a few more minutes, and she was in
the middle of the village&mdash;a very small village, consisting
of two streets composing the usual American
town cross, and half a dozen stores. Every one whom
she met knew just who she was (for had she not arrived
upon the evening previous?), and they all regarded her
with earnest scrutiny. The inhabitants of Ledgeville
themselves were never in the habit of coming down from
the Long Bridge with tear-stained faces, heaving bosoms
and a catch in their breath, but that Lassie did so,
caused them no surprise. Was she not of that unaccountable
multitude called "city folks?"</p>

<p>Lassie herself neither thought nor cared how she
appeared to the ruminative gaze of Ledgeville at first,
but as soon as she did notice the attention which she
was attracting, she wanted to get away from it as quickly
as possible, eyes being quite unbearable in her present
distress. She stopped and asked a kindly looking old
man where the bridge&mdash;the lower bridge&mdash;might
be, knowing that it would take her to solitude again.
The kindly old man pointed to where the bridge could
be seen, a block or so beyond, and she thanked him and<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
hurried on. It was a wooden bridge, very long; and the
river here glided in wonderful contrast to that other
aspect of itself which plunged so furiously from cataract
to cataract, a quarter of a mile further down the
course. How curious to think that all smooth-flowing
rivers have it in them to foam and rage and gnaw and
rend away the backbone of the globe itself, if driven in
among narrow and hard environment. Is there ever
any simile to those conditions in human lives, I wonder!
And then to consider on the other hand that there is
no volume of watery menace which, if spread between
banks of green with space to flow untrammeled, will
not become the greatest and most beneficial of all the
helpers of need and seed! That is also a simile&mdash;one
more cheerful and happy than the former, praise be to
God.</p>

<p>The river by Ledgeville is one of those flowing
smoothly and broadly between banks of green. So
smoothly and sweetly does it flow just there that it
might well have brought some quieting mood, some
gracious, even current of gently rippling peace, into
poor Lassie's throbbing heart, had she but been able to
receive any comfort at that moment. But meditation was
as far from her at this juncture as her mental attitude
was from Alva's, and more than that cannot be said
for either proposition.</p>

<p>So the river carried its lesson unread, while the girlish
figure traversed the bridge as quickly as it had
flown through the town, and, hurriedly turning at
the forking of the road beyond, started up the
hill. She knew that that way must lead to Ledge,
and eventually her own little hotel bedroom, that
longed for haven where she would be able to sit down<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
quietly, away from the sunlight and omnipresent
people, away from everything and everybody. Oh,
but it was freshly awful to think of Alva, her beautiful
Alva, and of what Alva was going to do! Marry that
man! Why, he would never even sit up again; he could
hardly see, the paper had said&mdash;the newspapers had
said&mdash;everybody had said.</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly and stood perfectly still. A
choking pain gripped her in the throat and side. Her
spiritual torment had suddenly yielded to her physical
lack of breath.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt there is nothing that will curb any
sentiment of any description so quickly as walking up
hill. Without in the slightest degree intending to be
flippant, I must say that in all my experience, personal
and observed, I have never yet felt or seen the emotion
which does not have to give way somewhat under that
particular form of exercise. In Lassie's case she found
herself to be so suddenly and completely exhausted
that she could hardly stand. Her knees, which had
seemed on the verge of giving out as she hurried down
the opposite bank, now really did fail her and, looking
despairingly about and feeling tears to be again perilously
near, she turned off of the road into the woods
that stretched down the bank and, treading rapidly
over soft turf and softer moss, came in a minute to a
solitude sufficiently removed to allow of her sinking
upon the ground and there giving out completely.</p>

<p>Oh, how she cried then! Cried in the unrestrained,
childish way that gasps for breath, and chokes and then
sobs afresh and aloud. She thought herself so safely
alone in the depths of the wood that she could gasp
and choke and sob to her heart's uttermost content, not<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
at all knowing that Fate, who does indeed weave a
mesh of the most intricate patterning, had even now
begun to interweave her destiny with that of&mdash;well,
let us say&mdash;of the dam at Ledgeville.</p>

<p>Alva's talk about the dam had gone in one ear and
out the other; Alva's words regarding Ingram had been
driven into the background of Lassie's brain by the
later surprises; but now things were to begin to alter.
We never can tell, when we weep over the frightful
love affair of a friend, what delightful plans that same
little Cupid may have for our own immediate comforting,
or how deftly he and the dark-veiled goddess may
have combined in future projects.</p>

<p>Sorrow is sorrow, but sometimes it comes with the
comforter close upon its heels, and when the sorrow is
really another's, and the comforter is unattached and
therefore may quite easily become one's own!&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, but all this is anticipating. It is true that disinterested
parties (like Joey Beall) always know everything
before those most interested have the slightest
suspicion of what is going on; but still it seems to me
unfair to take any advantage of two innocent people
as early in the game as the Sixth Chapter.</p>

<p>Therefore it shall only be said here that the party of
surveyors had employed that morning in sighting and
flagging up and down the banks beneath the Long
Bridge, and Ingram, having spent two hours in their
company, was now climbing the hillside for pure
athletic joy, being one of those who prefer a scramble
to a smooth road any day. As he came lightly up the
last long swing that measured the bank for him, he
surely was looking for nothing less in life than that
which he found at the top,&mdash;and yet that which he
<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>found at the top was not so disagreeable a surprise,
after all. For Lassie, even now when indubitably
miserable, pink-eyed and wretched, was still a very
pretty girl. A pretty girl is very much like a rose in the
rain&mdash;a few drops of water only add to its charm;
and so when Ingram came suddenly upon her, crying
there under a tree, and caused her to look up with a
little scream at the man crashing out of the bushes with
such a force of interruption as made her jump to her
feet and shrink quickly away&mdash;why, really it was all
far less startling and alarming than it sounds to read
about. For he at once exclaimed, "Surely you remember
me." And she saw who it was, stared at him
dazedly for an instant, and then dropped her face in
her hands again, realizing that he was the first of the
big world that "hadn't been told," and that he would
ask what was the matter, and that she must not tell
him. And so&mdash;and so&mdash;there was nothing to do but
hide her face&mdash;and collect her wits&mdash;and listen.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;SURELY YOU REMEMBER ME.&quot;</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said, and as she felt for her handkerchief
she could but think how hard it was to resist
sympathy when one's dearest friend was doing such
unheard-of things, and one had just learned about
them. Not that she would tell him why she was crying,
of course.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked again then&mdash;he was very
near now. "You know who I am. I used to know you
when you were a little girl. You remember?"</p>

<p>She was still feeling for her handkerchief, and he put
a great white one into her seeking hand. She wiped
her eyes with it and thought again that he must not be
told, and so said, with quivering lips:</p>

<p>"Oh, please leave me, please go away. Nothing is<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
the matter, but I must be alone. I want to be alone.
Please go away and leave me."</p>

<p>Ingram looked down upon her and, laying his hand
on her arm with a grasp that was so firm as to feel
brotherly (to one not yet a d&eacute;butante), said in a tone of
fascinating authority (to one not yet a d&eacute;butante):</p>

<p>"What is it? What is the trouble? You've had a
letter with bad news?" In his own mind he set it
down that she and Alva had had a misunderstanding
of some sort, but that opinion he would not
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," sobbed Lassie; "it isn't a letter&mdash;it is
Alva!" She paused and Ingram had just time enough
to reflect how quickly a man could see straight through
any woman, when Lassie could bear the burden of
reserve no longer, and with a wild burst of accelerated
woe cried: "She has told me her secret, and I listened
'way through to the end and then&mdash;then when I really
understood and realized what it all meant, then I could
not bear it, and so&mdash;and so&mdash;I ran away from her
and down the hill and across the bridge and came here
to be alone. And I wish you would go away and leave
me alone; oh, I want to be alone so very, very much,
for I cannot keep still unless I am alone; I am too
unhappy over it all. Too unhappy. And I have
promised her not to tell."</p>

<p>Ingram looked his startled sympathy. "What is the
trouble?" he asked. "Tell me; perhaps I can help
you. Why should you keep 'it' a secret? I'm her
friend, too, you know."</p>

<p>"But it isn't my secret, it's hers," Lassie sobbed;
"and I've promised; and, anyway, nobody or nothing
can help her. Nothing! Nobody!"<span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>"Is it really as bad as that?" said the man, looking
very serious.</p>

<p>Lassie was wringing her hands. "Oh, it's ever so
much worse than that; it's the very worst thing I ever
heard of. And that shows how bad I am; for Alva is
good, and it makes her happy!"</p>

<p>Naturally Ingram could not follow the reasoning
which caused her terminal phrase to serve as a sort of
mental apology for her way of looking at the affair,
but he was not alarmed by the breadth of her confession
of guilt, only unspeakably distressed by her distress, and
its mysterious cause.</p>

<p>"But what <i>is</i> it?" he asked. "What has Alva
done?"</p>

<p>"I musn't tell."</p>

<p>"Alva's not in any difficulty across the river there,
is she?" he hazarded.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she isn't in any difficulty; she is very,
very happy. That's what seems so awful about
it."</p>

<p>"What? I can't understand."</p>

<p>"I can't explain, either. And I musn't tell you.
It's going to drive me crazy to keep still, but I must not
tell."</p>

<p>"You can tell me;" his tone was suddenly authoritative
again (quite thrilling its young listener).</p>

<p>"No, I can't. I can't tell any one," but <i>her</i> tone was
wavering, with a catch in its note.</p>

<p>Ingram became instantly imperious.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can tell me! You must tell me! It will
relieve your mind, and perhaps I can help Alva."</p>

<p>"No, you can't help her; she doesn't want to be
helped."<span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>"Well, I can help you, anyway. Just telling me will
help you."</p>

<p>Lassie choked.</p>

<p>"Tell me at once," said Ingram, sternly; "I insist
upon knowing."</p>

<p>She looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Don't stop to think," he commanded; "tell me."</p>

<p>Oh, the intense relief of having a burdensome secret
torn from your keeping! Lassie felt that when in
trouble, a man was the friend to find&mdash;even before
one's d&eacute;but.</p>

<p>"You won't ever let her know that I told?" she
faltered.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"She didn't ask me really to promise; she only said
that I should be the only one to ever know."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I don't count. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, she is going to marry&mdash;" and then she told
him, with many halts and gasps, who; and then she
told him further, when.</p>

<p>Ingram listened, silent, turning white all about his
mouth. "She can't do it," he said, after a minute.
"That man may die any hour. It said so in last night's
paper."</p>

<p>"She is going to do it," Lassie said; "she doesn't
mind his dying&mdash;that is, she doesn't mind his dying
as most people do."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's horrible," he said then; "you were
right&mdash;it is awful. No wonder you were frightened
and ran away. She must be insane. I never heard of
such a thing." He went to the edge of the bank and
looked off for a little, standing there still, and then,
after a while, "Oh, my God!" he said; and then<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
again "Oh, my God!" and came back beside her.
His action, his evident emotion, quieted her own
strangely.</p>

<p>"Isn't it terrible?" she asked, almost timidly, when
he was close again; "it seems to me the most terrible
thing that I ever knew about."</p>

<p>"Very terrible," said the man, briefly. "We will
walk on up the hill," he added, after a little; "it's
near dinner time." She did as he said.</p>

<p>"You won't tell Alva that I told you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, indeed," and then both
were silent.</p>

<p>Towards the top, he asked: "How long shall you be
with her?"</p>

<p>"A week."</p>

<p>"That means until she leaves to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's good; I am glad that you can stay."</p>

<p>She tried to say something then, and her voice died in
one of those same strange gasps, but she tried a second
time and succeeded. "I suppose that nothing could be
done?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said.</p>

<p>He smiled a little oddly. "I am afraid that we should
be fools," he said; "those fools that rush in, you know.
It is beginning to come back to me how Alva looked and
how she spoke when I took her to see the house. It all
had no meaning to me then, but it has meaning now.
It comes back to me more and more. Perhaps you and
I are&mdash;are&mdash;not up to seeing it quite as she does.
Perhaps. It's possible."<span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>"That is what she says over and over&mdash;that I cannot
understand," Lassie said, faintly.</p>

<p>"I can't understand either, but&mdash;perhaps she does.
I <i>can</i> understand <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you know, anyway;" her tone was
sweet and confiding. He looked down into her pretty
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am, too," he said, heartily.</p>

<p>"But I hope that it wasn't very wrong for me to tell
you; it seemed as if I could not bear it alone!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that; Alva shall never know.
And now, if you cannot bear it (as you say) again, you
know that you can come to me and say what you like.
We shall have that comfort."</p>

<p>She smiled a little. "You don't seem like a stranger;
you seem like an old, old friend."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. Because I am an old, old friend in
reality, you know."</p>

<p>"But, if&mdash;if I&mdash;when I want&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know where to find me if you want
me?" He laughed. "It's true that I am an uncertain
quantity, but I take supper at the hotel every evening,
and sometimes I go to the post-office afterwards."
He smiled roundly at that, and she smiled, too. "We
must go to the post-office together, sometimes," he
added; "it's the great social diversion of Ledge."
He was glad to see her face and manner getting
easier. That was what he was trying for&mdash;to lift the
weight from her.</p>

<p>"Alva took me there this morning," she said.</p>

<p>They came now to the Soldiers' Monument and the
tracks.</p>

<p>"I hope that she isn't going to mind the way that I<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
left her!" the young girl exclaimed suddenly, smitten
with anxiety. "I ran away, you know; I couldn't
bear it another minute."</p>

<p>"She won't mind that," said Ingram; "all the
little things of life won't cut any figure with her any
more, if she's the kind that has made up her mind to do
such a thing. That's what I've been thinking all the
time that we were coming along; a woman who has
decided to marry in the way that Alva has, must of
course look at everything in life by a different light from
that of the rest of us; I don't know really that we have
the right even to criticize her. We don't understand her
at all; that's all it is."</p>

<p>Lassie looked astonished. "You don't mean to say
that you think that she isn't crazy?" she said.</p>

<p>Ingram smiled again, "I mean that I hardly think it
possible to judge what one cannot measure; savages
reverence the Unknown, you know, and I'm not sure
that reverence is not a fitter attitude towards mystery
than condemnation or ridicule, although of course it
isn't the civilized or popular standpoint."</p>

<p>"But do you think it's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's the thing, to
do&mdash;" Lassie could not get on further.</p>

<p>"I think it's just as awful as you do," he said quietly;
"but I've had time since you told me to see that just
because it seems awful to me, it's very plain to me that
I see it differently from the way in which she does.
She isn't a girl, she's a woman; and she's a very good
and sweet and true woman at that. If she is making
this marriage, the really awful part isn't the part that
you or I or the world are going to think about, it's
something else."</p>

<p>Lassie's glance rose doubtfully upward. "You<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
think that it's all right for her to do it, then?" she asked
miserably.</p>

<p>"I think that we aren't wise enough to talk about it
at all," said Ingram with determined cheerfulness.
"Let's change the subject. I am going to be here on
and off for a year, likely, and digging holes to hold little
flags, and drilling to keep track of what one drills
through isn't the liveliest fun in the world to look
forward to; so when Alva doesn't need you, do give me
some of your time and make me some jolly memories
to live on later, when I'm alone&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"You won't ever be able to go and see Alva in her
house afterwards, will you?" said Lassie, her mind
apparently unequal to changing the subject on short
notice; "because no one is ever to go there, she
says."</p>

<p>"I shall never go unless she asks me, surely."</p>

<p>They were now quite near the little hotel.</p>

<p>"Before we part, let us be a little conventional and
say that we are glad to have met one another," Ingram
suggested; "will you?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad that I met you," she said; "it will be a
great comfort&mdash;as you said."</p>

<p>Ingram was looking at her and that turned his face
towards the gorge. "I see Alva coming across the
bridge," he exclaimed; "go and meet her. Go to her
quite frankly, openly,&mdash;as if nothing had happened.
That will be easiest&mdash;and kindest&mdash;and best all
around."</p>

<p>She flashed a grateful glance to his eyes, and ran at
once down the tracks and out upon the bridge.</p>

<p>Alva came towards her, with a rapid step, her open
coat floating lightly back on either side. She smiled
<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
sweetly as she saw the girlish figure. "You beat me
home," she called out, gaily.</p>

<p>Lassie swallowed the lump in her throat and smiled,
too. "It's such a beautiful day, and I'm so happy and
so glad that you are happy!"</p>

<p>The pretty young voice rang fresh and true. The
next instant they were close, side by side.</p>

<p>Alva stood still. What Ingram had said proved most
truly true; she did not seem to hold any recollection of
that parting an hour before. She drew Lassie close
beside her and pointed over the bridge-rail. A rainbow
was spanning the Upper Falls, and its brilliant, evanescent
promise seemed to reflect in the face above. What
is so fragile, illusive, uncertain as a rainbow? And yet
it is the mirrored mirage of all the Eternal Purpose's
immutable law. Form is there, and color; hope is
there, and the will-o'-the-wisp of human struggles
evolving continually and, in their evolution, fading to
human eyes as they take their place up higher. From
the foaming, dashing water, which during the centuries
was strong enough to eat into the rock, arose the light,
lovely mist that in cycles of time was in its turn strong
enough to wear it away. Through the mist floated the
impalpable radiance that, in &aelig;ons to come, when rock
should again flash fiery through unending space, and
water should have evaporated to await fresh form,
would still continue to illuminate the Divine Will.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE LATHBUNS</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley, dropping into the post-office that
evening along about seven, was frankly disappointed
at finding her newspaper bundle still undisturbed
on the table in the adjoining kitchen.</p>

<p>"Why, I made sure you'd have laid 'em out, anyhow,"
she said, looking at Mrs. Ray, who was busily beating
batter; "you haven't even made a start." And she
sighed, seating herself in unwilling resignation.</p>

<p>"Made a start," said Mrs. Ray, glancing at her
placidity with an air of tart exasperation, "made fifty
starts, you mean. This has been what I call <i>a day</i>.
Mrs. Catt came in early this afternoon to ask me to
make Sally's wedding-cake, and Clay Wright Benton
was here about the parrot. He's awful tired of that
parrot 'cause it keeps his mother so tired and cross from
getting up nights to wait on it. It routs her up at all
hours for things, and if she don't hurry it calls her
names in Spanish that it learned on the ship coming
from Brazil, and, oh, they're having an awful time of
it. And then Sammy Adams was here too; he was here
from four o'clock on, asking me to marry him again.
I don't know as anything gives me a lower opinion of
Sammy than the way he sticks to wanting to marry me.
The older I get, the worse he wants to marry me, which
<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
shows me only too plainly as it ain't me at all he wants&mdash;it's
just my work."</p>

<p>"You ain't even unrolled it," said Mrs. Wiley,
fingering the bundle sadly. "I've been fixing onion-syrup
for Lottie Ann and thinking of you unrolling all
day. And you wasn't ever unrolling, even."</p>

<p>"He set right where you're setting now," said Mrs.
Ray, beating briskly. "I was stoning raisins, so he
wasn't in my way, but I do get tired of being asked to
marry men. They don't make no bones about the
business any more, and even a woman of my age likes
a <i>little</i> fluff of romance. Sammy always goes into how
we could join our chickens and our furniture. Like
they was going to be married, too. Oh, Sammy's
very mooney&mdash;he's very much like Mr. Ray. Most
men are too much like Mr. Ray to please me. There
was days when Mr. Ray 'd sit all day and tell me how he
had yellow curls and blue eyes before he had smallpox.
Those were his mooney days. When Mr. Ray
wanted to be specially nice, he always used to tell me
how pretty he was when he was a baby. Men are so
awful silly. It's too bad I ever married. I had so many
pleasant thoughts about men before. But now all I
think is they're all spying round for women to work for
'em."</p>

<p>"I never shall know no peace till I know whether
you can get my two backs out of these legs," said Mrs.
Wiley, handling the bundle. "Father was such a sitter
the last year, his legs was very wore at the top."
She sighed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Catt was here this afternoon, too," continued
Mrs. Ray, never ceasing to beat; "he wants to get up
a petition about the dam. He's afraid they won't pay<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
him for his orchard. He's against it. He says Mr.
Ledge is right. He says if he's going to lose money,
he'd rather see the Falls preserved for the blessings of
unborn generations. He says he doesn't believe we
think enough about unborn generations in this country.
He says his orchard is worth a lot."</p>

<p>"If they're too wore out to cut over, I suppose we'll
have to give it all up," said Mrs. Wiley. "Oh, Mrs.
Ray, Lottie Ann's so thin! I don't know what to do!
I say to her 'Lottie Ann, do eat,' and then she tries
and chokes. I think she ought to go to Buffalo and be
examined with a telescope. Rubbing her in goose-grease
don't do a bit of good, and it does ruin her flannels
so."</p>

<p>"I was sorry for Clay Wright Benton," pursued Mrs.
Ray; "he kind of wants me to take his mother and the
parrot for the winter. He says besides the nights, his
mother and the parrot quarrels so days that he's afraid
Sarah just won't have 'em in the house much longer.
She's losing all patience."</p>

<p>"If you <i>can't</i> get my fronts out of his legs, do you
suppose there'll be any way to get them out of his
fronts?" Mrs. Wiley propounded.</p>

<p>"I told Clay I'd see," continued Mrs. Ray. "I'm
pretty full now, but there's a proverb about room for
one more, and if I can't do nothing else my motto'll
help me out. 'He moves in a mysterious way' you
know, and maybe I can put her in my room with Willy
and move into the kitchen myself with the parrot. Yes,
indeed. Only I won't get up and wait on it. I don't
care what I get called in Spanish, if I'm once asleep for
the night, that parrot won't get me up again; or
there'll be more Spanish than his around."
<span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>"You'll be able to use the same buttons, anyhow,"
mused Mrs. Wiley. "Oh, Mrs. Ray, we've had a letter
from Uncle Purchase and the colt didn't die. It'll be
lame and blind in one eye, but anyway it's alive and it's
such a valuable colt. The father cost six thousand
dollars, and if it lives to have grandchildren maybe
they'll race. Uncle Purchase does so want a race-horse
in his stock. He says a race-horse even raises the value
of your pigs and cattle."</p>

<p>"Does a parrot sleep on its side or sit up all night, do
you know? I forgot to ask Clay."</p>

<p>"Oh, that reminds me, speakin' of sleepin'," exclaimed
Mrs. Wiley, suddenly arousing to the realization
of other woes than her own, "do you know Cousin
Granger Catterwallis was over this morning, and he
says those Lathbuns stayed at Sammy's the night afore
they came here. You know they come in a pourin' rain.
Did Sammy ever tell you about it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray stopped her beating. She stood seemingly
transfixed.</p>

<p>"Cousin Granger says they wanted to stay all night,
with him, but he's too afraid of a breach of promise suit
since his wife died, so he wouldn't keep them, but he
took his spy-glass and watched them through the gap
and they clum Sammy's fence," (Mrs. Ray's face was a
sight), "and then he went up to his cupalo and watched
them through a break in the trees, and he says he knows
they went in the house!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray folded her arms firmly. "Well," she said,
"I never heard the beat! Sammy never said one word
to me!"</p>

<p>"And Cousin Catterwallis says he doesn't believe
they've got any trunks or any money or any real love
<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
affair, except what they may manage to pick up along
the way. He says he wouldn't trust the young one as
far as you can throw a cat, and he says he wouldn't
trust the old one as far as that. Hannah Adele, indeed!
He says he don't believe she's even Hannah."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray drew a long breath. "Oh, well, I wasn't
meaning to marry him, anyhow," she said, a little
absent-mindedly. "I told him that to-day. Sammy's
mooney, and I've been married to one mooney man.
There were days when Mr. Ray would upset everything,
from the beehives to his second wife's baby&mdash;those
were his mooney days. I don't want to have no
more of that!"</p>

<p>"Cousin Catterwallis says it wasn't just proper taking
them in that way, either," Mrs. Wiley continued; "he's
going to see Jack O'Neil this afternoon, and tell him
his opinion. Cousin Catterwallis says the dam is
bringing very queer folks our way. He doesn't take no
interest in the dam because he's so far inland, but he
says when the canal was put through the Italians stole
one of his father's hens, and he hasn't any use for any
kind of improvements since then."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray began slowly beating her batter again. Her
lips were firm and her attitude painfully decided.</p>

<p>"The old lady says she's Mrs. Ida Lathbun," Mrs.
Wiley went on; "I wonder if their name is really
Lathbun."</p>

<p>"I d'n know, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley turned her eyes on the bundle.</p>

<p>"When do you think you can get at my coat, Mrs.
Ray?" the tone was sadly earnest.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, I guess. I haven't much on hand
to-morrow, except to sweep out the church and do some<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
baking. I was planning to dig potatoes and go to South
Ledge to fit a dress, but I'll leave that till early Monday.
Think of his keeping them all night and never telling
me!"</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go down to Nellie's," said Mrs. Wiley,
rising slowly; "the Lathbuns sit in her kitchen evenings,
and I'll just throw a few hints about and see how
they take it."</p>

<p>"I wish I could go, too," Mrs. Ray's eyes suddenly
became keenly bright, "but I can't. The mail's due."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley shook her head with the air of understanding
the weightiness of her friend's excuse. "I'll
stop in on my way back, and tell you what I find out,"
she said, kindly.</p>

<p>She went away and was absent all of an hour. When
she returned, Mrs. Ray's duties, both as postmistress
and stepmother, were over for that day, her cake was
safe in the oven, and she sat by the lamp, knitting.</p>

<p>"What'd you find out?" she said, as the door
yielded to Mrs. Wiley's push.</p>

<p>"Well, not much." Mrs. Wiley came in and sat
down. "They was both there in the kitchen, and
there's no use denying it's hard to find out anything
about folks when they're looking right at you.
But I did hear one thing you'll like to know, Mrs.
Ray?"</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, those two girls went off walking this morning,
and the young one came back with the man."</p>

<p>"Don't surprise me one bit," said Mrs. Ray. "I've
been saying that was what would happen from the
minute I knew she was coming."</p>

<p>"I'm sort of sorry for the older one," said Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
Wiley; "she's real nice. I'm sorry for any one who's
thinnish&mdash;Lottie Ann's so thin."</p>

<p>"Those kind of blind-eyed people always have
trouble, and nobody can help it for 'em," said Mrs.
Ray; "they make their own troubles as they go along&mdash;if
they don't come bump on to them while they're stargazing.
That girl's made for trouble; you can see it in
her eyes. But didn't you ask anything about Sammy?"</p>

<p>"I just couldn't&mdash;with them right there. The old
lady sits with her feet in the oven the whole time. I
don't see how Nellie cooks."</p>

<p>"Feet in the oven! I should say so! Well, I'll ask
Sammy just as soon as I see him&mdash;I know that! Did
you hear anything new about the dam?"</p>

<p>"No; Nellie says the surveyors say it'll be six months
before any one can tell anything."</p>

<p>"Huh!" Mrs. Ray's note was highly contemptuous.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Ray, don't you believe the surveyors?"</p>

<p>"I never say what I believe, Mrs. Wiley, it's enough
for me to say what I think; but I <i>will</i> say just this, and
that is that if we get the dam, it's precious little good
it'll ever do us here in Ledge. It's fine work talking, but
the legislature and the Dam Commission aren't working
day and night for our good. It's men in Rochester
and Buffalo who'll get the good out of the dam, and
we'll be left to find ourselves high and dry as usual."</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Ray, you talk as if you was against the
dam, or is it only because Sammy took those women in
that night?"</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Wiley! She had inadvertently hit the
bull's-eye. Mrs. Ray laid down her knitting and rose
at once.</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Wiley, it <i>isn't</i> because Sammy took those<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
women in that night. As if I'd care whether Sammy
took two women in or not! Did I ever care about Mr.
Ray's other two wives? or about their children? I
guess if I can stand all I've stood from Mr. Ray's first
wife's children, I won't care who Sammy Adams takes
in out of the wet. I'm surprised at you, Mrs. Wiley."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley got up in great confusion. "I hope you'll
excuse what I said, Mrs. Ray; you see I wasn't really
thinking what I did say. And it may not have been
them, anyhow. I must be goin', I guess; I don't like
to leave Lottie Ann alone like that. Good-by, Mrs.
Ray."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray folded her arms severely.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mrs. Wiley," she said, with reserve.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h3">MISS LATHBUN'S STORY</p>

<p>Curiously enough, just as Mrs. Wiley abruptly
terminated her call on her friend Mrs. Ray,
owing to the unpleasant twist given their conversation
by the Lathbun family, Lassie and Alva were
speaking of the same two ladies, whom Lassie had
met in the dining-room an hour before. Alva had
introduced her to both with that pleasant courtesy
which was given to none too careful social scrutiny.
It was Alva's habit to deal with all humanity on
a broad footing of equality&mdash;a habit which her well-born
friends politely termed a failing, and which those
of other classes accepted as the thirsty accept water,
just with content.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad I've seen them; now I feel as if I'd
seen everything, except the Lower Falls." Thus spoke
Lassie, when the bedroom door was shut, and she and
her friend seemed well away from all the rest of the
world for the next ten hours, at least. Lassie, be it
said, <i>en passant</i>, had now sufficiently digested her first
shock of surprise over her friend's future, to be able
to be pleasantly happy again.</p>

<p>"What did you think of them?" Alva answered,
half absent-mindedly. She held in her hand a letter
which the belated mail had brought, and her thoughts
seemed to quit it with difficulty.<span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>"I thought that they were rather common," said
Lassie, frankly. Lassie was well-born, and had judged
Mrs. Lathbun and her daughter by no higher standard
than that of their blouses.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I thought so, too,&mdash;at first," her
friend replied, putting the letter down and going to the
window where she remained with her back to Lassie,
looking out into the dark. "I thought at first that Mrs.
Lathbun looked like a cook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She dresses exactly like one," interposed Lassie.</p>

<p>"But I've come to like them very much, indeed. Of
course so few days are not enough to really know any
one, but the night before you came such a curious thing
happened. You know I told you that the daughter had
a love affair? Well, that was the night that I learned
about it. I never had anything come to me more
strangely. Do you know, dear, I am continually more
and more convinced that nothing happens by chance,
never."</p>

<p>"What did she tell you?"</p>

<p>Alva turned from the window and sat down by the
lamp-table. "I'll tell you; only you mustn't misjudge
Miss Lathbun for confiding in me. People
become friends very quickly in a lonely place like this,
you know."</p>

<p>"I won't misjudge her; I'll be glad to change my
opinion of her. She looks so like a restaurant girl."</p>

<p>"Lassie, you're incorrigible."</p>

<p>"But that dress, with that black cotton lace over
that old red silk."</p>

<p>"I never even noticed it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you've never noticed that dirty
red silk front?"<span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>Alva shaded her eyes with her hand. "Lassie,"
she said, almost sadly, "why does nothing count in this
world except the front of one's frock?"</p>

<p>Contrition smote the young girl. "Oh, forgive me,
forgive me," she pleaded; "I didn't think. I am
interested! Play I didn't speak in that way; I won't
again. Indeed, I won't."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll forgive you, dear; it's nothing to
forgive, anyway; but it makes it so hard to tell anything
serious when one sets out in such a way. I wonder how
many good and beautiful thoughts have died unexpressed,
just because their first breath was met with
mocking!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that; I won't be that way&mdash;I'll never
be that way again. I do like Miss Lathbun&mdash;truly I
do; I think she has sort of a sweet face, and she must
be clever to have been able to make a front of any kind
out of that lace. See, I'm quite serious now; and so
interested. Do go on!"</p>

<p>Alva looked at her for a minute with a smile.</p>

<p>"You can't possibly overlook the front, can you?"
she said; "but I will go on, and you will learn never to
judge again, as I learned myself; for I must tell you,
Lassie, that all you feel about them, I felt at first&mdash;until
I learned to know better. I didn't notice the front,
but I noticed some other things&mdash;little things like
grammar; but American grammar isn't a hard and
fast proposition, anyway, you know."</p>

<p>"They just call it 'dialect' in so many places," said
Lassie, wisely.</p>

<p>Alva smiled again. "Yes, they do," she assented.</p>

<p>"And now for Miss Lathbun's story?" suggested
the girl.<span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. Well, my dear, you see, I was sitting
here alone one evening, and she came to the door
and&mdash;and somehow she came in and we fell to talking.
You know how easy it is for any one to talk to me, and
after a while she told me her romance."</p>

<p>Lassie's eyes opened. "To think of a girl like that
having a romance! Please go on."</p>

<p>Alva hesitated, then smiled a little. "I suppose I can
trust you to keep a secret?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lassie began: "Why, of&mdash;" and then stopped
suddenly, remembering the morning's betrayal, and
blushed crimson.</p>

<p>Alva leaned forward and touched her cheek with one
petting finger.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, "don't feel distressed. I know
that you told Ronald and I don't mind."</p>

<p>"You know!" cried Lassie, astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I know. I saw it in both your faces when
I came across the bridge. I don't mind&mdash;I think it's
better so. Truly, I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alva&mdash;" the young girl's tone was full of
feeling.</p>

<p>"But you mustn't tell him Hannah Adele's love
affair," Alva went on, smiling; "remember that, my
dear."</p>

<p>"I promise. Now tell me all about it." Lassie drew
close, her face full of eager curiosity mixed with content
over being pardoned so simply.</p>

<p>"It's just like a story," Alva said, thoughtfully; "it's
more wonderful&mdash;almost&mdash;than my own. I never
heard anything quite so wonderfully story-like before.
Tell me, did you notice at supper how Mrs. Lathbun
watched every one that came off of the train? She<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
can see the station through the window from where she
sits, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't notice. Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; only I used to notice it and now I know
why she does it."</p>

<p>"Is she looking for the lover?"</p>

<p>"She's afraid of him, dear."</p>

<p>"Afraid!"</p>

<p>"Yes, afraid he'll find them."</p>

<p>"Goodness, are they hiding from him?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lathbun thinks that they are."</p>

<p>"And aren't they?"</p>

<p>Alva lowered her voice to a whisper. "He watches
outside of this house every night!" she said impressively.</p>

<p>Lassie quite jumped. "Watches! Outside this
house! Oh, is he there now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, perhaps so."</p>

<p>"What fun! Who does he watch for?"</p>

<p>"For Miss Lathbun, of course."</p>

<p>"But why does he do it?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't know; she only knows that he watches
there."</p>

<p>"And her mother doesn't know that he is there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How perfectly thrilling! Do go on!"</p>

<p>"It's really a very long story."</p>

<p>"I'll be patient."</p>

<p>"It taught me a big lesson, Lassie; it taught me not
to judge. Just see how quiet and simple these two look
to be, and yet that plain, ordinary appearing woman is
trying to hide her daughter from a rich man."</p>

<p>"A rich man!"<span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>"He's a millionaire."</p>

<p>"Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>Lassie stared. "Alva!&mdash;you don't believe that!
That woman's never hiding that girl from a millionaire.
It isn't possible!"</p>

<p>"But she is, my dear. She's a true, good mother;
she doesn't want her daughter to marry him, because he
is so dissipated."</p>

<p>"But I should think that they would run away and
get married. I'd marry a man, anyway, if I loved him."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lassie, you don't know what you'd do if you
were in the position of that poor girl. Her mother has
taken her away and is stopping here in this very quiet
and unassuming way to avoid all notice or being found
out."</p>

<p>"But he has found them out!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Mrs. Lathbun doesn't know it."</p>

<p>Lassie looked almost incredulous. "Mrs. Lathbun
doesn't look a bit like a woman who would hide her
daughter away from a millionaire," she said, obstinately.</p>

<p>"You see how easy it is to misjudge any one, Lassie;
because that's what she's doing."</p>

<p>"Mrs. O'Neil says they haven't any trunks or any
clothes. She said so this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I know; I've heard her say that before."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me the whole story."</p>

<p>Alva looked at her for a long dozen of seconds and
then her lips curved slightly. "I'm going to tell you,"
she said; "but, do you know, it just comes over me
that you are surely going to disbelieve it."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because it's so strange."<span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>"But you believed it?"</p>

<p>"But I can believe anything. Believing is my forte.
Once 'heretic' and 'unbeliever' meant the same thing;
well, I am a believer."</p>

<p>Lassie laughed a little. "Go on and tell me the
story," she said, "I'll try to believe;" then, her face
changing suddenly, she added, "it can have a happy
ending&mdash;can't it? Sometime?"</p>

<p>Alva flashed a quick, sad flash of understanding at
her. "All stories will have that some day," she said,
gently. It was the first reference on the lips of either to
that morning's revelation.</p>

<p>"Do tell me the story," Lassie begged, after a
minute's pause; "tell me the whole. Do you think
that perhaps he is out there now?"</p>

<p>Alva shook her head in protestation of ignorance as
to that. "It seems very medieval and devoted for him
to be out there at all, don't you think? And these
nights are so cold, too."</p>

<p>"I should think that some one would see him sometimes?"</p>

<p>"I should, too."</p>

<p>"Well, go on. Has she known him always?"</p>

<p>"No; it seems that he lives in Cromwell where her
mother was born, and she met him there two years ago
when they went there to visit."</p>

<p>"Did he fall in love with her at first sight?"</p>

<p>"I think so. She said the first thing that she knew he
was talking about her all the time, and then he began
watching outside of their house at night."</p>

<p>"Didn't he ever talk to her, or come inside the
house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lassie, what makes you say things like that?<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
They make the story seem absurd; and I began it
by telling you that her mother was bitterly opposed to
him on account of his reputation."</p>

<p>"I forgot," said Lassie, contritely; "is he so very
bad?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. He drinks and gambles and does
everything that he shouldn't, she says."</p>

<p>"But if he's rich he can afford it, can't he?"</p>

<p>Alva turned quickly. "How can you say a thing like
that? As if money can condone sin. Don't you know
that a thoroughly bad man is a soulless thing, and that
to marry a man like that is either heroic or deeply degrading,
just according to whether one does it for love
or for money."</p>

<p>"But you said that she loved him."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you said he could afford to be wicked!"</p>

<p>Lassie clasped her hands meditatively. "To think
of that girl having a millionaire watching outside her
window, nights! And Mrs. O'Neil says she hasn't even
a nightgown with her, so she can't possibly get up in the
cold to peep out through the blinds."</p>

<p>"I suppose she couldn't do that, anyway," said Alva;
"you see her mother doesn't know he's there, so she
couldn't get up to look."</p>

<p>"How does she know herself that he is there, then?
perhaps he tells her he watches and really stays in bed
at some hotel."</p>

<p>"Lassie!"</p>

<p>"What's the use of his watching, anyway? Does it
do any good? I should think that she'd be afraid that
he'd take cold. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lassie, don't you see that it's his only way to prove
his devotion? He can't write her, so he watches outside<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
her window, nights. She says that he takes a handful
of sand and throws it against the side of the house, and
she hears it and knows that he's there."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that?"</p>

<p>"I believe the whole story."</p>

<p>Lassie regarded her friend with amazement.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can;" she said; "why, those
two women would go almost wild for joy if any man
wanted to marry either of them."</p>

<p>"No, dear," Alva said, smiling; "no, they wouldn't.
The world isn't altogether worldly; there are simple,
true, wholesome natures in it that look at life in a
straightforward way without any illusions. And Mrs.
Lathbun is one of those. Poor she may be, but she
knows very well that no possible happiness can come to
her child from marrying a bad man who has money."</p>

<p>"But her daughter wants to marry him, and he wants
to marry her."</p>

<p>Alva paused before replying; then she said slowly:</p>

<p>"Lassie, there's the puzzle. Does he want to marry
her?"</p>

<p>Lassie looked startled. "Doesn't he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She doesn't know," said Alva; "you see, they have
hardly ever exchanged a word."</p>

<p>"Well," said the young girl, "this is the craziest
love story I ever heard in my life. Do you mean to say
that you believe that a man who had never heard a girl
speak would go and stay outside her window, all night
long? What does he do all night, anyhow; walk about,
or sit down? Alva, you can't believe that story?
Not possibly!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it," said Alva, cheerfully. "I believe
it for two or three very good reasons. One is that there<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
is no reason why the girl should construct such a silly
lie for my benefit; another is that truth is always
stranger than fiction; and the third is that she has a
little picture of him, and as soon as I saw the picture I
saw why Fate brought the Lathbuns and me together,
and why the man waited outside her window all night."</p>

<p>"Why?" Lassie's tone became suddenly curious.</p>

<p>"My dear, the man is the image of the man that I
love. They might be twin brothers. And men of such
strength put through whatever they lay their hands
unto."</p>

<p>Lassie appeared dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"He looks like&mdash;" she stammered and halted.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," Alva said, simply; "he looks exactly
like him! Now you see why I am interested. Now you
see why I find it easy to believe. A bad man&mdash;a
thoroughly bad man&mdash;is a creature that for some
reason has not come into his heavenly birthright. If
that girl, plain and pale and unassuming as she looks,
has the power to draw him from nights of dissipation
to nights in the cold outside her window, she has the
power to call a soul to him or waken his own that is but
sleeping. It takes a great deal of living and learning to
attain to the faith which I have, but I have it and I am
firm in it, and I believe the story and I believe that
good is brewing for that man. I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>Alva spoke with such energetic earnestness, such dominating
force, that Lassie was silenced for the minute.</p>

<p>"I suppose that I am just stupid," she said, after a
little; "I've had so much that was different to try and
learn to-day."</p>

<p>There was a pathos in her tone that led the older
girl to lean quickly near and take one of her hands,<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
drawing her close as she did so. "I know it, dear,
I know it. And I appreciate it all more than you
guess. We won't talk of Miss Lathbun any more
just now, and, dear, believe me when I say that
I'm truly very glad that you met Ronald just as
you did this morning and told him what I had told
you. I see all this from all its sides, and the views
that differ from mine don't hurt me&mdash;believe me,
they don't. I understand exactly how Ronald's fine,
robust manhood would revolt quite as you yourself
revolted; but, you and he, with all the possibilities of
your gorgeous, glorious youth, can no more measure the
joy of these days to my love and myself, than the gay
little birds measure what life is to you. To us, you two
and your ideas are very much like the birds; we are
glad to see you enjoy the sunshine, and our better gladness
we know is quite beyond you."</p>

<p>Lassie turned her face upward to the earnest look
and tender kiss, and then they sat still for a little until
Alva rose and began to make ready for bed.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, as she loosened her hair; "it
was like this, wasn't it? At first Ronald was almost
angry; and then his feeling changed and he felt that
because it was I, it was rather a different thing from
what it would have been if it had been any one else."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lassie, in an awestruck tone, "it was
just like that. How did you know?"</p>

<p>Alva laughed. "Not because I am a witch," she
said, "but just because I know Ronald. You see,
Lassie, I am much stronger than Ronald; I am stronger
than Ronald, just as Ronald is stronger than you. He
could not condemn me; he has to own I am right. Right
is a might so great that wherever it holds good it rules<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
its kind. Ronald gives me my due; you will, too, after a
while. Only I must not drive either of you forward too
quickly." She laughed a little. "I must give you
time," she added.</p>

<p>Lassie was taking down her own hair. She shook it
apart now, and looked forth from between the parted
waves, her expression one of deeply stirred interest.
"I believe that this is going to be the most wonderful
time in my life," she said; "I feel as if everything were
getting deeper around me."</p>

<p>"Ah, dearest," said her friend, with a sigh that was
not sad&mdash;only a long breath; "that's very true. I
should not have sent for you, only that I knew that
when you came to leave me and go back to the world to
wear your white gown and make your d&eacute;but, you would
have become a stronger, better, wiser, sweeter woman
all your life through, for this experience. You see, dear
child, the rarest thing in the world of to-day is sincerity&mdash;absolute
truth. I am not especially gifted or very
remarkable in any way, but I have learned the value of
being sincere. It isn't a small thing to learn in life, Lassie,
and it isn't a small privilege to live for a few days
with one who has learned the lesson. When you see
what truth really is, and what it may really do for one,
you won't be revolted by my marriage; you will never
wonder over me any more, and you'll learn to look at
strange stories with a new light of comprehension."</p>

<p>Lassie went close to her, put up her lips and kissed
her.</p>

<p>"And I can tell Mr. Ingram about Miss Lathbun,
too?" she asked very simply; "or must I keep that
secret, as you said at first?"</p>

<p>Alva put her arms fondly about the pretty young<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
thing. "Lassie," she said, "you are a dear, and I
don't mind how much you discuss me with Ronald;
but you musn't tell him Miss Lathbun's secret. It
wouldn't be right."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I won't," said Lassie; "and I
will keep my word, too."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Alva said, patting her face caressingly;
"thank you, and heaven bless you and give you a good
understanding."</p>

<p>Lassie looked up with a smile. "You think I may
learn to look at things in your way?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Alva; "looking at things in my
way has made me a very happy woman, and so I desire
the same for you."</p>

<p>Then she kissed her good night.<span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h3">PLEASANT CONVERSE</p>

<p>"Well, what did I tell you?" said Mrs. Ray to
Mrs. Catt, a day or so later, when that lady
had dropped in for a little call. "Those two young
people up at Nellie O'Neil's have fallen in love just
as sure as beans are beans. Not that he's so young,
either, but a man's always able to fall in love whenever
he gets a chance. Age don't matter. There was Mr.
Ray. He was always in love unless he was married.
Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"If he's engaged to that other one, I shouldn't
think he'd find it very easy to fall in love right under her
nose, so to speak," said Mrs. Catt.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't notice," said Mrs. Ray, adjusting
her shawl, and turning the needlework in her hands;
"she's the kind who don't even see the things they go
headlong over. She's the mooney kind. I know. Yes,
indeed. Mr. Ray had mooney days. There were days
when Mr. Ray called me by his first wife's name all
day. Those were his mooney days."</p>

<p>"My cousin Eliza thinks she's crazy too. She says
she's seen her time and again setting on stumps in the
woods, and she turns out in the road for sparrows.
And then that house. They're at it tooth and nail
from dawn to dark. I never see nothing like it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ray; "there's others say that, too.<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
She is queer! Nellie says she often doesn't eat breakfast&mdash;nor
any meat either. And she talks about the
dam as if we was all heathens laying the axe at the
root of our own mothers. She says all the trees ought
to belong to the United States Government. As if
we wasn't singing 'Pass under the rod of the Republican
party' from dawn to dark now. Such a country!"</p>

<p>"She goes down to see Mr. Ledge, too," pursued
Mrs. Catt; "of course he don't want the dam, and he
makes her more so. Josiah Bates was driving home
from Castile the other day, and he saw her coming
from there. Josiah said he was sure she'd been to see
Mr. Ledge, 'cause she wasn't ten feet from the house,
and they was waving their hands to her from the window.
You can always depend on Josiah Bates knowing
what he's talking about."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ray, turning her work about;
"yes, Josiah Bates is a very careful observer. He'll
never die of no fish-bone in his throat for want of
watching the fish."</p>

<p>"Speaking of fish-bones," said Mrs. Catt, "have
you seen Lottie Ann Wiley lately? There's a bag of
bones for you!"</p>

<p>"Not for a week or so. Why? Is she thinner than
she was?"</p>

<p>"Thinner! Well, I should say so. I don't know
what the Wileys will do with that girl if she keeps on
getting thinner and paler."</p>

<p>"She isn't any paler than that girl at Nellie O'Neil's."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"That Lathbun girl. Do you know anything about
them?"</p>

<p>"That's what every one's asking."<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ray threaded her needle. "They're a queer
pair," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so. They don't eat any breakfast,
either; make it up on chestnuts. They're picking
chestnuts all over. Lizzie says she never saw people
making so free. Folks don't know what to say, but
it riles a good many. They pick that little gray bag
they've got full three or four times a day."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," said Mrs. Ray; "do you suppose
they eat 'em all?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Catt rose. "I only stopped for a minute," she
said. "Oh, I don't know, I'm sure. Chestnuts is
hearty, but seems to me they ought to ask at the houses,
anyway. Mrs. Wiley says if they come to her trees
again, she'll turn the bull in the lot."</p>

<p>"Must you go?" Mrs. Ray asked. "I thought
Mrs. Wiley was afraid of the bull."</p>

<p>"Yes, I must. What you making?"</p>

<p>"I'm putting a new lining in this vest for Elmer
Hoskins. His dog chewed it up, while he was asleep."</p>

<p>"Did he have it on?" Mrs. Catt asked in great
surprise.</p>

<p>"No; he had it on the chair and it fell off."</p>

<p>"Fell off! I s'pose you've heard about Gran'ma
Benton's parrot falling off?"</p>

<p>"Falling off what? No, I haven't heard."</p>

<p>"Fell off the perch. I saw poor Clay this morning,
and he's half mad. The parrot and Gran'ma Benton
have been discussing most all night lately, and the
parrot gets so mad he hops all over and last night he
got in a rage and fell off the perch. Broke the perch,
too."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," said Mrs. Ray; "why don't Clay
<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
show some spirit and put a stop to all that? I
would."</p>

<p>"He can't. Gran'ma Benton's so fond of discussing,
and if she didn't have the parrot she'd soon wear them
all out."</p>

<p>"I thought she was wearing them out as it is."</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;" Mrs. Catt looked cornered, "but,
anyhow, they don't have to do the talking now&mdash;the
parrot does it. I'd like to see my husband's mother
have a parrot&mdash;that's all!" Mrs. Catt twitched her
shawl expressively.</p>

<p>"Poor Clay Wright Benton," said Mrs. Ray. "Just
to look at him you'd know it all. I do despise men who
haven't got any spirit; but if they have spirit of course
they're almost worse to get on with. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Mrs. Catt with meaning;
"well, good-by, Mrs. Ray."</p>

<p>"Oh! Good-by."</p>

<p>Mrs. Catt went out.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes later that Mrs. Wiley
arrived, with another large bundle wrapped up in
newspaper.</p>

<p>"Don't stop your work," she said, putting it down
with a sigh. "Oh, you ain't sewing on my coat," she
added, in a tone of deep disappointment, evidently
seeing interruption in a changed light at once.</p>

<p>"No, but I've cut it out. What you got there?"</p>

<p>"I've got another suit of father's."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray eyed the bundle with thoughtfully compressed
lips, and gave her shawl a fresh tuck.</p>

<p>"What you want made out of this one?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley hesitated. "It's such a handsome piece
of cloth," she said, "I'm willing to leave the cut to you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but I thought maybe you could get a winter jacket for
Lottie Ann out of this one?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray compressed her lips more, and frowned.
"I don't know about that," she said, shaking her head.
"I've had trouble enough with the last."</p>

<p>"This was his new when he died. After he reached
three hundred. And it isn't worn anywhere. You can
get her big sleeves out of the hips, I think."</p>

<p>"There's a good deal to a coat beside the sleeves,"
said Mrs. Ray; "that coat of yours has most drove
me mad. I never thought of your bringing me another.
Well, unroll it and let me look at it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley began to unfasten the package.</p>

<p>"Any moth-holes in this one?" Mrs. Ray asked,
with professional interest.</p>

<p>"None to speak of. The only real hole is where he
sat down on a engine spark at the station, the day of
his last shock."</p>

<p>"It isn't the suit he had on when the oil-tank exploded,
then?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Wiley; "that was the last but one.
The oil-tank was the middle one of his three shocks."</p>

<p>She unfolded the garments and spread them out.
Mrs. Ray watched her, and continued her work at the
same time.</p>

<p>"How's Lottie Ann?" she asked, presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's poorly," said Mrs. Wiley. "We're
getting awful worried over Lottie Ann. I thought
maybe you could get her fronts out of his fronts; you
see, she's slimmer than I am."</p>

<p>"But her big spread will come lower than yours,"
said Mrs. Ray; "is there any up and down to the
cloth? How much does she weigh, anyhow?"<span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, there is an up and down. Ninety-six last time.
That's mighty little for her height. She only wanted it
short, anyway."</p>

<p>"It'll have to be short. Yes, indeed. Why you must
have weighed most double that at her age. It's too
bad men always have pockets."</p>

<p>"He would have them; you know how father always
set store by pockets. There, that's the engine spark.
I don't know, I'm sure, what we'll do about her. Mr.
Wiley says his grandmother went just so&mdash;" Mrs.
Wiley's voice broke suddenly; she took out her handkerchief
and dried her eyes. "Do you see any way to
getting the fronts out?" she asked, falteringly, after a
minute.</p>

<p>"You musn't look to the worst that way," said Mrs.
Ray, soothingly; "those thin girls pick up wonderfully.
The only way I see is if you've got braid. If
you've got any braid, I can piece it back of the braid.
She may marry and be as well as any one. Look at
her great-grandmother you just spoke of. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"I haven't got any braid. But I can buy some. Judy
was up from the St. Helena road yesterday, and she
said to give her milk&mdash;all she'll drink."</p>

<p>"Turn it over so I can see the back," said Mrs. Ray;
"will she drink it, though? That's the question. She
was up for the mail two nights ago, and I thought she
looked pretty well-willed. That's a nice piece of cloth.
My, but you were lucky he didn't have it on when the
oil-tank exploded. Yes, indeed. It's better cloth than
the other."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I think. That's just the trouble,
Mrs. Ray; she will <i>not</i> drink it."</p>

<p>"You never was severe enough with her. Not but<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
what if it hadn't burnt through you could get the oil
out, maybe."</p>

<p>"I know it, but she's my only girl. I thought you
could use the same buttons. Eleven boys, and then that
one girl. She's named for Mr. Wiley's mother and my
mother. Charlotte, you know. See, Mrs. Ray, there's
six of each size, one on each cuff, too. And all so stout
but her. The boys and their father got together on the
hay scales the other day, and they went up over two
thousand pounds. Did you hear about it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray stopped sewing and scanned the new
proposition with one eye half closed.</p>

<p>"I'd have to piece the sleeves; you'd have to make
up your mind to that. Were they in the wagon?"</p>

<p>"No, just standing on the scales. You think you can
manage it if you piece them&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can manage it then. I can get my backs out
below the knee, and get her sides out of his backs."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Ray, you've taken a load off my mind.
I'm so glad to get these awful sad remembrances done
some good with. I made pillow-slips out of his nightshirts,
but his flannels will haunt me till I die. Eddy's
the only one of the boys that is ever going to grow to
them, and Eddy never wears flannel."</p>

<p>"I should think you could use 'em up to cover the
ironing-table. Who did you say was picking chestnuts,&mdash;Mrs.
Lathbun and her daughter?"</p>

<p>"I haven't said a word about them." Mrs. Wiley
opened her eyes widely. "But I'm hearing about them
all over. I don't believe she's her daughter any more
than you are. They're a nice pair, those two. Chestnuts
six dollars a bushel, and they picking them morn,
noon, and night. Have you seen Sammy Adams? He<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
took them in the night before they got here, you know.
You heard of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did." Mrs. Ray's lips came together; "I
shall ask him all about that taking them in, the first
time I see him. Never bought a stamp yet! Such
doings! They're not respectable. Don't tell <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"You're terrible prejudiced in your opinions, Mrs.
Ray; you judge everybody by the stamps they buy."</p>

<p>"It's all I have to judge strangers by," said Mrs.
Ray, "and it's a pretty good guide, too. Mrs. Lathbun
don't buy stamps and nobody can't tell me that she's
on the square. Wait till I see Sammy!"</p>

<p>"When do you think you can try mine on?" asked
Mrs. Wiley.</p>

<p>"Will next Thursday do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't want to wear it till Thanksgiving;
I won't go to Buffalo till Christmas. Lottie Ann won't
want hers till then."</p>

<p>"I can do them both by Thanksgiving," said Mrs.
Ray. "I've got a few little jobs to do for others,
and I want to build a new back fence, and I guess
I'm going to get the contract for whitewashing the
church cellar, I'm bidding on it. But after that, except
for my house-cleaning and my boarders and my
regular duties under the United States Government, I
haven't got anything particular on hand."</p>

<p>"I'll be so glad," said Mrs. Wiley, moving towards
the door. "We're all so kind of upset about not knowing
whether Uncle Purchase will come and live with
us or not if the dam goes through, that I want to have
my things in order, anyhow. He wrote, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know, but I guess he'll come and live
with you, anyway," said Mrs. Ray; "good-by."<span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley went out, and before long there was
another caller,&mdash;Clay Wright Benton himself this
time, usually called "poor Clay Wright Benton" by his
friends, for the simple reason that he was Sarah Benton's
husband, and his mother's son.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do," he said, opening the door a few
inches and looking in through it. "No, I won't come
in; I only stopped to speak about the hay. You said
I could have it, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Mrs. Ray; "but I said, if you
came before October first. That's past now, and Elmer
took it off yesterday. Him and his dog was here at
sun up and away again by noon. You see now what it
is to take your own time."</p>

<p>Clay Wright Benton stood still, turning his cap about
and about.</p>

<p>"I thought you knew I wanted it," he said, finally;
"I couldn't come sooner."</p>

<p>"I did know. But I thought you needed a lesson.
Nobody that wants to get ahead in this world can take
their own time. You've got to be a little ahead of other
people's time if you really want to make your mark.
How's Susan? Got back from her father's yet?"</p>

<p>"No," said the man; "she's going to stay till
Thanksgiving. She was so awful tired of the parrot."</p>

<p>"Look out you don't leave her too long&mdash;same as
the hay," said Mrs. Ray, cheerfully. "Who's that
coming up the steps behind you? I can feel the draught
as long as you stand there in the crack, but I can't see
through your body."</p>

<p>Clay Wright Benton moved aside, and Mrs. Dunstall
pushed past him. "I'm sorry I was late about the<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
hay," he said then, and went slowly away. Mrs. Benton
and his mother had left very little spirit in him.</p>

<p>"What did he come for?" asked Mrs. Dunstall,
shutting the door tightly. "I'm sorry for Susan. She
married him for his looks, and looks is all he ever had
to give her." The attitude of the community was that
of larger communities towards the humbly unsuccessful
in life.</p>

<p>"He ain't giving her even looks, any more," said
Mrs. Ray; "she's gone home, and his looks is gone
heaven knows where. No man was ever so handsome
yet that he could rise above needing to shave."</p>

<p>"He'll make his fortune if the dam goes through,
though," observed Mrs. Dunstall; "he owns all the
land above Ledgeville."</p>

<p>"He'll never see her for dust then," said Mrs. Ray,
drily. "She'll leave him to keep house for Gran'ma
Benton and the parrot. Well, what did you come for?"</p>

<p>"I was walking by, and I thought I'd just stop and
ask you if you'd heard about that Mrs. Lathbun and
her daughter staying all night with Sammy Adams?
Josiah Bates was up that way for a load of apples and
he heard of it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray became rigid. "I have heard of it," she
said; "but not from Sammy. He was here and never
said a thing about it, but some one else told me. So
it's all over town now, is it?"</p>

<p>"They was walking across country and there came
on a rain and they stopped for shelter and it was
Sammy's where they stopped."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray sewed very fast. "I always said they were
tramps anyway," she said, haughtily; "now you'll all
see."<span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>"Seems funny Sammy never told you about it."</p>

<p>"Well, he never did."</p>

<p>"He tells you everything&mdash;don't he?"</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"It couldn't be he really took a fancy to either of
'em," reflected Mrs. Dunstall; "I don't think they're
good-looking."</p>

<p>"Good-looking!"</p>

<p>"But you know, men are queer, Mrs. Ray. There
was Mr. Ray. He was queer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray gave her thread a jerk that broke it.</p>

<p>"They never get any letter, do they? You said
they never did, didn't you?" Mrs. Dunstall was all
query.</p>

<p>"No, they never get any letters."</p>

<p>"They claim to come from Cromwell, don't they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never heard. I wouldn't believe
anything they said. No trunks and stealing
chestnuts all over. I never!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a funny thing if, after all these
years, some stranger like those two was to come in from
saints-know-where and marry Sammy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be funny," said Mrs. Ray, "very
funny. Yes, indeed. Yes, it would be <i>very</i> funny!"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd just stop and tell you," said Mrs.
Dunstall. "I knew you'd be interested. I know you're
such a friend of Sammy's. I thought if you knew,
maybe you could look 'em up a little. Nathan's got
an aunt living in Cromwell. If I was you I'd look 'em
up, Mrs. Ray."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray opened her scissors like the jaws of a
shark.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> looking 'em up," she said, and the scissors<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
closed with a snap full of meaning; "they'll soon find
what it means to get no letters and write no letters and
stop with Sammy Adams when it rains. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>Two hours later every one in the township&mdash;that
is, every one except the boarders of the O'Neil House&mdash;knew
that Mrs. Ray was actively advocating an investigation
into the Lathbuns' history.</p>

<p>"I guess she'll find out a good deal," said Samuel
Peterkin to Judy, as they drove home towards the St.
Helena road.</p>

<p>The scene far and near was one maddest autumn
blaze of beauty.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ray will never let up on him till she does,"
said Judy; "she's awful mad at Sammy."</p>

<p>The road bent between giant pines, and revealed the
gray facade of the High Banks beyond, stretching in
gigantic grandeur between the black shadows below
and the bewildering colors above.</p>

<p>"If these trees was down, what a long ways we could
see along the river," said Samuel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Judy, "trees is dreadfully in the way
when you want to see. And to think that Mr. Ledge is
always talking about having planted ten thousand of
them. People are curious."</p>

<p>The sun came out upon the horizon behind them at
that minute, and shot a shaft of glory down the ca&ntilde;on,
illuminating all the gray rock with silver.</p>

<p>"There, now," said Judy; "it's late when it's like
that. It's right in our eyes, too. We must hurry."</p>

<p>"I told you you were staying too long," said Samuel;
"and you know as well as I do that nobody can trot
the St. Helena hill."<span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BROADER MEANING</p>

<p>It is surprising how quickly any situation can be assimilated.
Be it ever so pleasant or ever so painful,
we get accustomed to its demands surprisingly soon,
and whether it is the fact that one has just gotten a
fortune, or just gotten the toothache, in either case it
seems as if one had had it always, before one has
hardly had it at all.</p>

<p>Lassie learned this with great rapidity. Before three
days had passed by, she discovered that the deep and
earnest joy in Alva's mind had eradicated all the horror
in her own. Alva's love ceased to seem shocking&mdash;it
seemed, instead, more like some beautiful, mysterious
wonder. Lassie came to hear her friend talk without
any distress&mdash;only with a sort of wistful ignorance&mdash;a
longing to fathom depths not before even apprehended.</p>

<p>"It doesn't strike me as it did at first at all," she
said to Ingram one night, as they went for the mail
together. "All that I think of now is how happy she
looks. Did you ever see any one look as happy as
she does?"</p>

<p>"She's very happy, surely," said Ingram; "but
what uses me up is that she is looking forward
so. Why, that man is dying&mdash;he may die any day<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>&mdash;and
she thinks that he will come here. He can't
ever come here, not possibly!"</p>

<p>"Oh, can't he?" Lassie cried, in real distress,
"are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Of course. He knows it, too."</p>

<p>"But she doesn't know it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that he ought to tell her, then?"</p>

<p>Ingram did not speak for a minute. "Perhaps some
miracle may come to pass, and he may live," he said
then; "you see, he has lived three weeks longer than
any man in his circumstances ought to expect to
live."</p>

<p>"Oh, then he hasn't got to die soon?"</p>

<p>Ingram knit his brows in the dark. "I can't explain
myself clearly," he said; "but it seems to me that he
and Alva sort of rise above rules, so to speak. Part of
the time she's as she always was&mdash;just as we are&mdash;and
then again I feel as if she herself had gone and left
me sitting with just a figure of some sort.&mdash;" He
paused. "I expect he's the same way," he added,
after a second; "it's all beyond me."</p>

<p>"It's strange, isn't it?" Lassie spoke thoughtfully.
"She's very sweet and lovely, and dear with it all.
But I know just what you mean; I've seen it, too. She
is talking, and then she stops and that white look comes
over her face, and I never speak then until she does.
Do you know," she said, almost timidly, "I keep
thinking of things I've read in books about the Middle
Ages,&mdash;about saints; about 'ecstasy,' they called it.
We say 'ecstasies' about hats, or little dogs, or the
flowers at Easter; but when Alva has been talking
about her life in that house and stops to think, and I<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
see her face, I feel as if I understood what the word
really and truly meant."</p>

<p>"I suppose there's no danger of her converting you,"
said Ingram; "it's all very well for her, but I should
hate to have you that way."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the girl, in surprise.</p>

<p>"It isn't human, that's why," the man declared,
energetically. "We're past the Middle Ages," he
added, with a little laugh, "far past now."</p>

<p>"You think that people can be too good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I wouldn't marry a woman like her for
anything!"</p>

<p>"But you thought differently once," said Lassie,
shyly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, easily, "I wanted to marry her once,
but she wouldn't have it at all. Droll&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>"We're ever so far by the post-office; do you know
it?" she said.</p>

<p>"So we are; I'd forgotten all about the mail."</p>

<p>They turned back.</p>

<p>"But I don't believe that Alva ever could make you
see life in the way that she does," Ingram said, tentatively;
"does she ever try?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Lassie; "she just talks
to me of her happiness."</p>

<p>"What would become of the world, I wonder, if
every one adopted her views," suggested the man.</p>

<p>They turned in at Mrs. Ray's gate just here. The
mail was distributed, and every one else had taken
theirs and gone.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a little late," said Mrs. Ray, cheerfully.
"Mary Cody run up for the house letters when
she saw you go by. Have a nice walk?"<span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, very," said Ingram.</p>

<p>"You're great walkers down your way. Mrs. Lathbun
and her daughter walk all day long, seems to
me."</p>

<p>"They do walk a good deal," said Lassie.</p>

<p>Then she and Ingram went back to the hotel. They
found Alva standing by the dining-room door with
her lamp and her letters in her hand. Mrs. O'Neil
stood close before her.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry," said Alva to Mrs. O'Neil;
"I don't believe one word of it."</p>

<p>"When they're out to-morrow I shall sweep the room
<i>myself</i>," said Mrs. O'Neil, decidedly; "you can learn
a good deal about people by sweeping their room."
Then they all separated, Ingram going to his letters,
their hostess to her husband, and Alva and Lassie to
their cosy nest up-stairs.</p>

<p>"What was the matter?" Lassie asked, directly
their doors were shut.</p>

<p>"Nothing especial," Alva said, laughing; "it was
just that Mrs. Ray came here this afternoon and
rather upset Mrs. O'Neil by talking about Mrs. Lathbun
and her daughter."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say anything in particular&mdash;she just
talked."</p>

<p>"What did she talk, then?"</p>

<p>"She talked all sorts of things; she doesn't like
them at all. She doesn't consider them nice."</p>

<p>Lassie was silent. She was conscious of a painful
lack of admiration for either Mrs. Lathbun or her
daughter, herself.</p>

<p>A freight train began to roll by and ended conversation<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
for the time being. Alva went to the window and
stood there. After a while she spoke musingly.</p>

<p>"Everything must have a purpose. Every action
has to have a thought behind it. If we could only
see through the veil!"</p>

<p>The train, which had come to a standstill, now began
to move again, cracking and straining at first, then
going on with a terrific roar.</p>

<p>"They serve their purpose surely&mdash;the freight
trains," Alva said; "even if they did nothing else,
their noise accomplishes something. One might forget
life so easily in this corner of the world, if it were
not for them."</p>

<p>Lassie laughed. "But they serve a few more purposes
than that."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I never deny the broader meaning
in life&mdash;if the world's view <i>is</i> the broader one&mdash;but
trains mean such a great deal besides what they carry,
in a little bit of a town. I used to think that they came
pretty close to being all the meaning that life had to the
people there, and I still wonder sometimes if it isn't
so. I've lived here well over one week now, and really
it seems to me that the trains, their comings and goings,
and whether they do them on time or not, are the only
topics of conversation that are ever broached."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they talk about other things when we're
not around," suggested Lassie, wisely.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that. Or perhaps they think
the trains our only mutual interest. You know,
Lassie, there really is no one that is stupid, unless you
do your half towards being stupid, too. It's like the
crash in the wilderness, which doesn't mean sound
unless there are ears to hear it."<span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Lassie; "isn't
there really any sound in the wilderness? What happens
when the tigers roar?"</p>

<p>"But of course they do talk about other things here,"
Alva continued, paying no attention to her friend's
flippancy. "They talk about the dam, and they talk
about me."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they say about you?"
Lassie asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"I know exactly what they say," Alva replied, a
real amusement curling her lips; "they say that
Ronald and I are going to be married and live in that
house while he builds the dam."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know that the dam was decided on."</p>

<p>"It isn't, my dear, and I don't believe myself that
there ever will be any dam. I can't believe that this
State, even in her grossest materialism, will have the
face to accept a royal gift and then turn around and
give it away in direct contradiction of the terms of its
acceptance."</p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that?"</p>

<p>"It's very bad. That dear old gentleman has made
the preservation of this wonder of nature the realized
dream of his whole life. He's carried through no end
of other big philanthropic schemes, but he never for
one instant allowed anything to turn him aside from
this one. He told me himself how he had rewooded
the banks&mdash;he has planted thousands and thousands
of trees&mdash;and now to have the whole threatened.
It's shameful, shameful!"</p>

<p>"Does every one know how you feel?"<span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, every one knows how I feel."</p>

<p>"What do they think themselves?"</p>

<p>"I believe the predominant sentiment in Ledge is
that it will be entertaining to see Ledgeville drowned
for good and all."</p>

<p>Lassie laughed.</p>

<p>The freight train was all gone by now. Alva turned
from the window and came back to a seat beside her
friend, sinking upon it with a little sigh.</p>

<p>"All this goes very near with me, dear," she said,
gently; "loving Nature and fighting for the future has
been <i>his</i> life-work, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," Lassie said, softly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the older one leaned close and put her arms
about the young girl. "It's so heaven-blessed to have
you here,&mdash;it makes me so happy."</p>

<p>"I'm very happy, too," said Lassie. "I never had
just the feeling before in my life that I have with you
these days&mdash;it's as if nothing could ever come between
us. Sort of as if we had been sealed to a compact."</p>

<p>Alva patted the brown waves of hair. "That's the
understanding of true friendship, dear," she said;
"nothing ever can come between us. Once two people
realize mutual truth, how can anything come between
them again? All the trouble in the world arises out of
falseness. Search in your mind, and see if it isn't
so?"</p>

<p>Lassie reflected. "You're putting so many new ideas
into my head," she said, "I suppose I'll go home with
nothing of my old self left in me."</p>

<p>"Not quite that," said Alva. "Your old self
wasn't so bad, Lassie, dear. But the world has a way
of hammering all its votaries into a certain set of molds,<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
and I'd like to see you casting, instead of cast,&mdash;do
you know the difference?"</p>

<p>"Alva," said Lassie, with sudden appealing earnestness,
"you weren't like this when I saw you last; what
changed you?"</p>

<p>"I had the convictions then, but not the courage.
Now I have the courage, too."</p>

<p>"What gave you the courage?"</p>

<p>"Surely you can divine?"</p>

<p>"Love."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, love. Love for him. All courage has
its root in love of some kind."</p>

<p>"Alva, you teach me more each day."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll teach you more and more and more
yet, and so on and so on until we part, and then I'll go
on learning myself."</p>

<p>"Hasn't your lesson any end?"</p>

<p>"Love hasn't any end, dear, any more than it has
any beginning. And so my lesson hasn't any end,
either."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say, but that isn't
real love. That which can end has never been,&mdash;all
the real things in existence are eternal."</p>

<p>"But they&mdash;the people that&mdash;well, you know,
they thought that it was love&mdash;didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, and little children think that there are
bears in dark closets, and ever so many people think
that money buys happiness. The world is full of lies,
Lassie, but if one puts the test to them they all fade
away. You don't understand yet&mdash;but wait."</p>

<p>"I want to understand."</p>

<p>"But you are not ready to understand yet."<span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>"But I am ready, I will learn to be ready."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm going to teach you. But I have to
go slowly because I have to hunt for the words. You
are such a little thing&mdash;such a baby&mdash;to be trusted
with life; because you see most people never live&mdash;they
just exist. They are only a few steps up on the
staircase, and when they are dragged or pushed above
the place that they are in by nature, they are apt to be
dizzy. I want to teach you life, Lassie; but I don't
want to make you dizzy." She paused, and a whimsical
little smile danced across her face; "and besides, dear,
we must get undressed. It is after ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Just a minute more, Alva; it seems as if I cannot
break off right here. And I won't be dizzy. I know
that whatever you think and do must be right and best.
I want to learn to think just as you do. I want to be
told how you learned. I always knew you were so
very good, and truly, dear, I wouldn't have been surprised
if you'd chosen to marry a missionary or to go
to that island where the lepers are&mdash;not after the first
minute, you know; it would have been just like you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Lassie, it wouldn't have been like me at
all. For ever so many reasons. My first duty in life&mdash;the
duty that comes before every other&mdash;is to my
father and mother. No claim could be strong enough
to justify my leaving them; and then, besides, I'm
not a Christian, except in the sense that I believe with
Christ, and that isn't enough for any mission or any
leper nowadays."</p>

<p>There was a little pause; then Lassie said: "But
you are going to leave your father and mother now,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>Alva smiled. "But for such a little while, dear,"<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
she said, gently; "you forget how short the time is
to be!" There was an instant's pause and then she
turned suddenly and her face had the bright color
of deep emotion flaming in it. "Lassie, Lassie," she
exclaimed, with a strength of feeling that startled
the other into a sudden cry, "I'm trying to be calm,
I'm trying to talk to you quietly,&mdash;I don't want you
to think me a mad woman,&mdash;but I am so much closer
to some other keener, sharper world of soul and sensation
than you or any one can realize, that I can hardly
curb myself to the dull, unknowing, unfeeling, throb,
throb, of this one. Don't you know, Lassie, that
people are getting married every day,"&mdash;she stopped
and pressed her hands tightly together, her eyes starring
the pallor of her face with that curious radiance of which
the young girl had spoken to Ronald. "Oh," she
went on, "to think that people are getting married
every day because they need cooks or because they need
care, or because the man has money or because the
girl is pretty, and they go forth un-understanding, and
they live along somehow; and the word that means
their sort of companionship is all that I can use to
speak of the evening that I shall return here, his wife,
and fall on my knees beside him and realize that
all my loneliness and waiting and hoping has ended,
and that at last&mdash;at last&mdash;we are to be together,
even if only for a few weeks, a few days, a few hours.
A foretaste of eternity! A memory of what was in the
beginning of all things!"</p>

<p>Ceasing to speak, she clasped her hands more tightly
yet, and her eyes closed slowly. Lassie sat still and
trembling. Her breath came unevenly, but she saw
that Alva's swept in and out of her bosom with a wide<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
evenness that belies unconquered emotion. After a
minute the other opened her eyes and laid her hand
lightly upon the girl's head. "I frighten you, I know
that I frighten you," she said; "you think that I am
crazy after all."</p>

<p>"No, I don't, Alva; but I can't think what kind of
a man the man can be to make you feel that marrying
him will be so different from marrying any other man."</p>

<p>"You can't think, because you don't know what love
can mean to people&mdash;what it has meant to him or
what it has meant to me."</p>

<p>Then she sprang up and began to undress herself
rapidly.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can bring yourself back to
earth, Alva, after you have felt like that."</p>

<p>Alva smiled. "But we must live on the earth, Lassie,
and be of the earth. We are made for the earth. God
gave us our souls, and he gave us our bodies, too.
And he meant both to work together."</p>

<p>Lassie sat still and meditative. She had herself
been carried out beyond her depth and could not get
back easily. She was, in truth, a little dizzy.<span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h3">THE WAR-PATH</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray in the post-office managed to keep track
of Mrs. O'Neil's personal sweeping of the
Lathbun bedroom until it was terminated. Then
she left the United States Government's appointment
in charge of Mr. Ray's first wife's youngest daughter,
and hied herself down the hill.</p>

<p>Mary Cody and Mrs. O'Neil were in the kitchen
discussing the results of the investigation when she
entered.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll never guess what I found," said the
landlord's wife; "you'd never guess if you guessed
till Doomsday."</p>

<p>"What did you find?" Mrs. Ray tucked in the ends
of her shawl with fierce joy,&mdash;"a pistol?"</p>

<p>"No;" Nellie O'Neil's brown eyes glowed and her
face shone; "guess again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't guess," said Mrs. Ray, impatiently.
"A monkey? A love-letter from the king of England?
A lot of stamps? I don't know,&mdash;I can't guess."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil nodded her head very slowly, and with
deeply seated meaning.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Mrs. Ray, "tell me. I'm in a hurry.
Yes, I am."</p>

<p>"I found six case-knives!"</p>

<p>"Six case-knives!"<span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I found."</p>

<p>"Six case-knives! Well, of all the&mdash;What did
they want them for?"</p>

<p>"One was broke off short."</p>

<p>"Any blood on it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Ray!"</p>

<p>"Well, I just asked."</p>

<p>"They were all clean."</p>

<p>"And one broke off?&mdash;hum!"</p>

<p>"What do you think about it, Mrs. Ray?"</p>

<p>"I hope it'll be a lesson to Sammy Adams never to
take two strange women in on a rainy night again.
The Bible, even, is severe on strange women."</p>

<p>"Did he take them in?" Mrs. O'Neil opened her
brown eyes widely.</p>

<p>"Take them in! He kept them all night. Haven't
you heard about it? And never told me, either. That's
just like a man. Flattering himself that I'd give a
second thought to any woman living. Six, you say,
Nellie, and one broke off?"</p>

<p>"The broken one is one of the six."</p>

<p>"They could have broken it off in his heart, just
as easy! My, to think of the chances that man took!
Didn't they have anything else? Did you look under
the mattress?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;I looked everywhere. There's a hair-brush
that I'd have thrown into the gorge a year ago
if it had been mine, and a bent pin and a broken mirror,
and that's all."</p>

<p>"I declare. Well, it's a very good thing that I set
you to looking them up. Yes, indeed. I shall look
them up in all directions now, myself. I shan't leave a
stone unturned that I can even tip up on one side. To<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
think of those case-knives! And one broke off! And
Sammy Adams taking them in like that! But then, it
isn't for you to criticize him, Nellie, for you've taken
them in yourself. You can thank your stars you
haven't had a case-knife stuck in you before now.
How do they carry them, anyway?"</p>

<p>"They were wrapped in a piece of red flannel."</p>

<p>"Red flannel! Why, you said all they had beside
the knives was the hair-brush and the mirror. Red
flannel,&mdash;hum! So blood wouldn't show on it, I
expect. Was the edge of the blade of the broken one
rusted at all?"</p>

<p>"Not that I noticed."</p>

<p>"Noticed!"</p>

<p>"Don't you want to come up and see for yourself,
Mrs. Ray?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. They might come in. It wouldn't
look well for any one in the employ of the United States
Government to be found spying about, you know. I'm
always having to consider my country. Yes, indeed.
But what do you suppose they have those knives for?
I never heard of such a thing in all my life. Even if
they used them for tooth-brushes, they'd only want
one apiece."</p>

<p>"I think you'd better come up-stairs."</p>

<p>"And Sammy Adams taking them in like that!
That poor innocent! Not but what he was a fool;
think of me opening my doors to two tramps!"</p>

<p>"Come on up-stairs. They won't be back till noon.
They've gone chestnutting in the Wiley wood. They
can't be back till noon."</p>

<p>The door opened just here, and Alva came in with
Lassie behind her.<span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>"Have you told them?" Mrs. Ray asked.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Alva asked.</p>

<p>"We don't know what to think about Mrs. Lathbun
and her daughter," said Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>Alva glanced quickly into both their faces and then
at Lassie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray tucked the ends of her shawl in, folded
her arms, and closed her lips tightly for a second before
opening them to speak. "I never did like their
looks," she declared. "I'm not surprised over what's
come out!"</p>

<p>"I never liked their looks, either," said Lassie,
"but what is it? Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Ray, "nothing in particular, only
we're beginning to find them out. You can't pretend
to be somebody forever without any trunks. Case-knives
are good in their way, but they don't take the
place of trunks."</p>

<p>"Case-knives!" Alva exclaimed. "Oh, what do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"There, Nellie, you see how they strike any one,"
said Mrs. Ray, with deep meaning.</p>

<p>"But have they case-knives with them?" Alva asked,&mdash;"not
really?"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. O'Neil told her story.</p>

<p>"You'd better all lock your doors nights after this,"
said Mrs. Ray; "you don't want to take Sammy
Adams' chances if you can help it."</p>

<p>"But what should they have the knives for?" Lassie
asked.</p>

<p>"They have their reasons," said Mrs. Ray, darkly;
"you know you told me the other day, Nellie, that the
reason why they sat in the kitchen with their feet in<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
the oven so much was because their shoes was all wore
out; they've got their reasons for everything they do,
depend on it. If they're honest, why don't they have
their shoes patched when they're wore out? If they
were respectable, why didn't that girl buy some black
laces instead of wearing brown ones. I always keep
black shoe-laces in my grocery business."</p>

<p>"Maybe she doesn't know that," suggested Lassie.</p>

<p>"Yes, she does know," said Mrs. Ray, "for I told
her so one day when she played come for mail."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you kept shoe-laces," said Mrs.
O'Neil. "I've always bought them in Buffalo."</p>

<p>"Well, I do. Yes, indeed. I keep pretty nearly
everything&mdash;except case-knives. There's nothing out
of place in keeping shoe-laces in a grocery business,
not until after you begin to wear them, and for my own
part they seem to me just as decent as shoe buttons
which all the town would be up in surprise if I didn't
have them in my grocery business."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew you kept shoe buttons," said Mrs.
O'Neil.</p>

<p>"I keep everything, except strange women travelling
after dark. My store is a general one. I thank heaven
there's nothing of the specialist in me. I'd of starved
if there was, or been obliged to charge very high for
very little work, which would mean starving in a while
anyhow, so being no doctor I couldn't stay a specialist
long even if I tried."</p>

<p>"I think you ought to come up-stairs and see their
room, Mrs. Ray," Mrs. O'Neil said, going back to the
main question.</p>

<p>"What is it about their room?" Lassie asked.</p>

<p>"There isn't anything about it&mdash;that's what it is,"<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
said Mrs. Ray; "respectable people always have things
about their room. Yes, indeed. But of course women
walking across country nights can't carry much fancy
fixings even if they don't mind stopping all night wherever
the rain catches them."</p>

<p>"Did they stop over night anywhere?" Lassie
asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray adjusted her shawl. "Such doings!"
she muttered; "I never heard the like. That's one
way to work the game. I never had any game. I
just had the work. Whenever there came up something
as had to be done that nobody in town could do, I
was glad to learn how for the money. Yes, indeed.
And now they come along and live on the fat of the land,
case-knives and all."</p>

<p>"Do let's go up and see the room," pleaded Mrs.
O'Neil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray wavered. "Well, if Mary Cody will
stand in the hall and watch?" she stipulated.</p>

<p>"And you must come, too," said Mrs. O'Neil to
her two guests; "there isn't anything to see&mdash;it
isn't prying&mdash;it's just the wonder how they can get
along without anything at all that way."</p>

<p>Alva was rather pale.</p>

<p>"Do let's go," Lassie whispered.</p>

<p>Alva smiled sadly. "Yes, we'll go," she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil called Mary Cody and stationed her
below. Then they all four mounted the stairs and went
along the plain hall to the plain door at the end.</p>

<p>"You keep everything very neat, Nellie," said Mrs.
Ray; "it's a pity you don't stick to nice people who can
appreciate nice things. If you go taking in people like
the Lathbuns too often, you might just as well give up<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
and get the name for it. I wouldn't dare stay under the
same roof with them, myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil made no answer, simply pressing the
door at the end of the hall and&mdash;as the door yielded&mdash;entering
first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray and Lassie were next. Alva did not go
in, but stood still in the doorway.</p>

<p>It is hard to conceive the special effect of that interior
on each of the four.</p>

<p>"Did you have any little things around before you
swept?" Mrs. Ray asked, standing in the middle like
the head of some royal commission in the days of the
Dissolution.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil&mdash;in the capacity of the layman left
to represent the monks flown&mdash;replied that she had
found all as bare as now.</p>

<p>"Well, you told the truth, Nellie," her friend remarked;
"there's the hair-brush and here's the mirror.
But where are the knives?"</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil pulled open the upper drawer, and in
one corner lay the roll of red flannel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray unrolled the knives and examined them
with care. A case-knife is rather limited as to its power
of revelation, however, and she soon laid them down.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" she said, with heaviest emphasis.</p>

<p>"What do they sleep in, or wash with?" Mrs. O'Neil
suggested.</p>

<p>"The towels are yours, of course, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Lassie looked around the simple bedroom with its
absolute bareness. She felt pitiful.</p>

<p>"They're comin' over the post-office hill!" Mary
Cody suddenly yelled below. The effect was magical.<span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>Lassie and Alva fled into their room.</p>

<p>"I feel like a burglar myself," exclaimed the young
girl, as she shut their door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray was going down the stairs in the hall outside.
"There," she exclaimed, "did you hear that?
That's the way it goes when you harbor criminals.
They're very catching."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you really think they're criminals?" Mrs.
O'Neil asked, in great distress.</p>

<p>"Well, Nellie, put the case-knives and Sammy
Adams together, and then the way they pick up other
folks' chestnuts and having no comb and only half a
brush for the two of 'em&mdash;it looks bad in my eyes."</p>

<p>"But what shall I do?" Mrs. O'Neil asked.</p>

<p>"Ask Jack if they pay their board regularly; that'll
help you to know some," propounded the postmistress
solemnly, and then she returned to her government
duties forthwith.<span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h3">ANOTHER PATH</p>

<p>As Lassie closed the door, Alva moved to her
favorite post by the window and stood there
looking out; the young girl looked anxiously towards
her friend. "What happens to those people doesn't
really matter to us, does it?" she asked after a minute,
some atmosphere of trouble permeating her.</p>

<p>"Everything matters, dear."</p>

<p>"But, Alva, you hardly know them, and they <i>are</i>
common."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, dear, but that room,&mdash;two weeks in
that room with nothing, no comforts such as we think
absolutely essential&mdash;oh, it makes me feel terribly.
Life is such a puzzle. Ledge seemed such a simple-hearted,
secluded little nook,&mdash;and first I ran into
the big, soul-wringing problem of the dam, and now
here are these two lives. Lassie, whatever else they may
or may not be, they are human. It can't be joy to
live like that. There must be some reason for their
doing as they do, and I can see no reason except the
one the girl told me."</p>

<p>Lassie began to wash and brush for dinner; Alva
continued to stand at the window.</p>

<p>"That was the first time that I ever went into a
room where I was possibly not wanted," she continued,
presently. "It seemed so strange. And such a room,<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
too. Oh, it all has made me fairly heart-sick. I
wonder what the end is to be. As I say so often,
there are no accidents, no chance happenings in life;
if anything enters within my circle, there is a reason for
it. Either they are to do for me, or I am to do for them,
and I wish I knew which it were to be. I am so sorry
for them!"</p>

<p>"Then you don't think that they can be doing wrong&mdash;are
perhaps bad?"</p>

<p>"No," said Alva, firmly; "I'll never think that of
any one. Nobody is ever bad. The word is too complete.
It says more than it means to express."</p>

<p>"They couldn't be going to do anything for you."</p>

<p>"How can you tell, Lassie? Sometimes in doing
for others we do a thousand times more for ourselves.
Haven't you learned that yet?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet&mdash;not with people of that sort."</p>

<p>"They don't look to be so wrong," Alva spoke half-musingly.
"They just look like plain, quiet people.
I'm sure there's no evil in them!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she made up the love affair?"</p>

<p>"She never made that man up, Lassie; that man is
a real man. You can't 'make up' men like that."</p>

<p>"But if he is rich and loves her, would he let her
be living this way and chasing her around that way.
That does seem so awfully funny, to me,&mdash;for a rich
man to spend the nights outside the window of a girl
who hasn't even a change of pocket-handkerchiefs,&mdash;and
she isn't pretty either, you have to admit that,
Alva?"</p>

<p>"Lassie, you do look at everything from such a
petty, worldly standpoint. Of course it isn't your fault,
but you judge too easily. How do you know what rule<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
governs that man; there are some men that no one can
understand,&mdash;they seem to be a race apart. All their
springs of action differ from the usual sources. I've
been in love with such a man&mdash;I'm in love with him
now&mdash;I am going to marry him. The ordinary woman
wouldn't care much for a love that had to be set aside
for bigger things, as his for me was at first. But I
understood. I accepted the situation. All situations
have their key&mdash;their clue&mdash;if one can get a little
way outside of body and senses, and then study them
thoughtfully."</p>

<p>"Well, but if the man is an exceptional man as yours
is, what can interest him in such a girl?"</p>

<p>Alva shook her head. "You don't find her interesting,
and you will never go near enough to her spirit
to change your view; but she interests me, and some day
you'll come to see that every human being is full of
interest, if we will but take the trouble to hunt the
interest out. I have learned that lesson, and all that I
can think of is the apparent trouble and need of these
two."</p>

<p>"Would you have a man as great as the man you
love, marry such a girl with such a mother, Alva?"</p>

<p>"I would have people who love sincerely always
marry, whoever they love."</p>

<p>"But if he is so wild that a woman who hasn't even
an extra hairpin wants to hide her daughter from him,
do you think he'll make her happy?"</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Lassie," her friend said, presently, "do you know
I used to be just like you. I saw only the finite,
too."</p>

<p>"Yes?"<span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, and I often wonder what would have become
of me if I had not learned through love to finally escape
out of the bonds and shackles of ordinary conditions,
and to contemplate them only as either behind or below
me. How can we judge in the case of another? All
that I know absolutely in this case is that I have strayed
into the midst of a pitiful story. All I can do is to try
to help that pain. That poor girl is nothing but a
passing ghost to you; to me she is a link in the chain-armor
of life that covers my spirit during its earthly war.
As I said before, there are no chance meetings, there
are no accidents; there's nothing trivial in life after
one once grasps the greatness of the whole. You can
make things trivial by belittling them, or you can make
them great. I make Miss Lathbun great because a
man who is great is interested in her."</p>

<p>"But how do you know that he's great? Or that he
is interested in her? She may have made it all up; I
think that she did, myself."</p>

<p>Alva turned from the window.</p>

<p>"My dear child," she said, approaching the girl
and laying her hand on her shoulder, "I feel as if there
were a thick veil between us; how can I tell you what I
think, when you don't want to understand what I try
to say? Suppose she did make it up? Suppose she
and her mother are anything you please? Still, I'd
be glad that I believed in them. One little grain of
real belief may possibly be the seed of a new life for
them; and even if it isn't, think what it means to me to
be able to believe in people. It means that I am looking
for good, instead of looking for evil. Can't you see how
much better that must be for me personally?"</p>

<p>Lassie lifted her eyes to see what she called "the<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
white look," on Alva's face. She felt ashamed of her
own standpoint.</p>

<p>At that instant the dinner-bell rang loudly below.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll see them now!" Lassie exclaimed, all
other thoughts fading.</p>

<p>Alva gave her a quiet glance. "Yes, we'll see them
now," she said, turning towards the door.<span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h3">AND STILL ANOTHER PATH</p>

<p>It is difficult for one who has never taken an ocean
voyage or lived in a small village to realize the
tremendous strides which interest, friendship, love, or
confidence can make in a very few days, or even hours.
I met three girls once whose kind parents had provided
them with a chaperon and sent them abroad to improve
their minds. They met men on the Lusitania (a record
trip, too) going over, and all three were engaged when
they landed. Instead of improving their minds in
Europe, they bought their trousseaux, and then came
home (another record trip) and were married. A small
village is just the same; one is introduced and after
that it goes like the wind. Women tell each other everything
that they shouldn't, and virtues which would never
be noticed in a city beget the deepest and sincerest
admiration and affection. The dearth of conventionality
and variety draw spirits easily together. Perhaps
the purer air is a universal solvent for pride and prejudice.
At any rate, to make a long story short, Lassie
and Ingram were in love with each other before Alva
had finished having the porch of her house painted,
or before Mrs. Ray had succeeded in tracking the case-knives
to their suspicious lair of crime.</p>

<p>It's delightful to fall in love on the sea or in the
country, quite as delightful as to fall in love anywhere<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
else. It is too bad that fickleness is rated so low, for
really the emotion of slowly discovering that one is
entering Elysium should be too great an experience to
be foregone forever after. However, we must not
forget that fickleness is rated low because humanity
long since discovered that being in Elysium is still
better than making an entrance there, and furthermore
that of all sharp edges known, Love is the one most
easily dulled by usage. Therefore it is best to adhere
to the dear old rules for the dear old game, and only
thank Fate with special reverence when sea-breezes
or country zephyrs float around one's own personal
setting-out.</p>

<p>Lassie didn't know that she was in love; she only
knew that she was very happy. Ingram didn't know
that he was in love; he only knew that he was very
happy. Alva, whose soul sank daily deeper into the
near approaching abyss of her profound longings,
noticed nothing. But every one else knew, of course.
Joey Beall, the invisibly omnipresent, saw them alone
together somewhere nearly every day. Mrs. Ray
watched them come and go together for mail. Mrs.
O'Neil, who never had believed that Ingram was in love
with Alva, wished them well with all her heart. For she
felt sure that Alva wasn't in love with Ingram, either.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to have something pleasant before my
eyes just now," she said to Mary Cody, and Mary Cody
knew that she referred to the feeling over the dam,
which daily grew keener, and to the Lathbuns, who,
it was now openly known, had never paid any board
since their arrival, but merely referred to their banker
in Cromwell, who, it appeared, was out of town, and
could not send on their October check until his return.<span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>"I don't know what there is about looking at them,"
said Mary Cody, who was fifteen and grown up at that
(and who did not refer to Mrs. Lathbun and her
daughter); "but every time he looks at her while I'm
waiting on them, I feel as if I'd just about die of joy
if Ed Griggs would look at me once that way."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," said Mrs. O'Neil, severely.</p>

<p>The days which bore such momentous happenings
upon their bosom flowed swiftly on, and the week
was speeding by&mdash;was gone, in fact.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible, does it?" Lassie said,
as she came across the bridge with Ingram one afternoon.
He had happened to return from the long-distance
telephone in Ledgeville by way of Alva's
house; and she had happened to be ready to go home,
and Alva had happened not to be ready. "It doesn't
seem that it can be only a week. I feel as if it were
months, instead. Do you remember that first day,
when Alva told me, how I cried and how horrible I
thought it was. And now I feel as if it were too sad
for words, but something so great and lovely and sacred,
that I'm sort of hushed in joy to have seen it all. I
can see her side now, and when I go back to the world
and hear people say the things that I thought myself
when she first told me, I know that they are going to
hurt me awfully. And yet she says that they will not
hurt her."</p>

<p>"No," said Ingram, thoughtfully, "she seems to
be quite beyond being hurt. I never saw any one who
impressed me just as Alva does."</p>

<p>"It's very wonderful to be with her all the time,"
Lassie went on; "nothing seems to affect her for herself,
but only things about other people. She doesn't<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
seem to think her thoughts for herself any more, but
just for others. It's how she can study and learn and
carry on some part of his work for him after he's gone;
it's how she can teach the people around here that
Ledge won't profit in the end by being turned into a
big lake or a big manufacturing district; it's how she
can only prove to people that those two queer women
are really honest, and really nice to know."</p>

<p>"And do you agree with all her views now?"
Ingram asked, recalling the first of their meetings
and the difference in Lassie's views from her friend's
then.</p>

<p>"I think it's very splendid how she loves. I thought
it was terrible at first, but now I&mdash;" she hesitated;
"I"&mdash;she stopped altogether.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Ingram; "what were you going to
say?"</p>

<p>The girl looked down the ca&ntilde;on of gray, barren
beauty, and then up towards the sunlit valley of sweet,
sunshiny, farming country. "Perhaps you won't
believe me," she said, her eyes for the minute almost as
distant in their withdrawal as Alva's own; "but now,
I&mdash;truly&mdash;I envy her. I would give anything to
love as she does. I would almost give the world to
see life as she sees it. You see, I have begun to understand
what she means when she says things."</p>

<p>Ingram was deeply stirred by pathos of which Lassie
herself was ignorant. The young desire to learn to
drink of bitter waters! The longing towards the crown
of thorns stirs them, because they can appreciate the
sublimity of martyrdom, and cannot measure the
agony!</p>

<p>She had stopped and laid her hand upon the bridge-rail.<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
Involuntarily he laid his hand upon it, holding
it within his strength and warmth.</p>

<p>"When she talks to me of him," Lassie went on,
seeming unconscious of the hand and looking far
ahead, "I forget myself, I forget Mamma, I forget
my d&eacute;but; I live only in her and her hope. I never
saw love like hers; she lives in him&mdash;in it&mdash;not in
the world, and she's so sure of the next world and of
their future. It goes all through me, the wonder of it.
I can't tell you how I envy her. She said when I came
that she would send me back home all different, and
I see now that she will do it."</p>

<p>"But I don't want you different." The words burst
from the man's lips. Mountain tops are serene and
glorious and very close to the clouds, but oh, the good
warmth, the dear, cosy loveliness of those soft green
slopes far&mdash;so far&mdash;below.</p>

<p>Lassie was too deeply engrossed to notice. "I shall
go back to my home a better girl," she said; "and I
shan't let myself forget what I've learned here."</p>

<p>Ingram thought that she had heard, and felt himself
silenced.</p>

<p>There was a minute of stillness, and then they walked
on. The October evening was falling chill, and the
night wind came winding up the gorge.</p>

<p>"Do you agree with her about the dam, too?"
the man asked finally, as they approached the end
of the bridge, striving against an echo of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she has converted me about that, too.
She took me down to call on Mr. Ledge, and when I
saw that dear, courtly, old gentleman, and heard how
quietly and earnestly and sadly he and Alva talked<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
about it, I came to see how different all that was,
too."</p>

<p>Ingram waited a second or two; then he said:</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Lathbun,&mdash;do you believe in her too,
now?"</p>

<p>Lassie laughed. "No, I don't," she said, very
positively; "I'm awfully sorry for them both, but I
cannot believe in them."</p>

<p>"Alva does."</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;but Alva&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, well,&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"I mustn't. Indeed I mustn't. I promised, and
this time I must keep my word. But Alva has a reason
for believing in them."</p>

<p>"Is it a good reason?"</p>

<p>Lassie reflected. "No," she said, finally; "I don't
think that it is a good reason at all."</p>

<p>They were at the hotel door now.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry for Alva," said Ingram, "because
I hate to see ideals shattered."</p>

<p>"Oh, but they may justify her faith."</p>

<p>"I am more inclined to think that they will justify
your doubts."</p>

<p>Lassie looked pleased. She valued Ingram's opinion
highly.</p>

<p>A little later Alva herself came home, pale as she
always was, but more weary looking than nightfall
usually found her.</p>

<p>"Lie down before supper," Lassie suggested; and
her friend accepted the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Come and sit beside me," she said, in a tone that
was almost pleading; "give me your hand. I'm really
quite used up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p><p>Lassie perched beside her on the bed, and took the
long slender hand between her own pretty little white
ones.</p>

<p>"You are a wise little maiden," Alva said, smiling
into her face. "I shall fight this away quickly. I
know much better than to be weak. I understand the
scientific, spiritual reasons for it quite well&mdash;it is
that I am under a double strain these days, and also&mdash;"
she hesitated&mdash;"I think that I am really under a triple
strain," she said, "you do not guess how close to my
heart that poor girl has come through her description
of her lover. I think of her so often, and such a strange
undercurrent sweeps up in me. I try to understand it,
and I can't; but I wonder if it can be some troubling
of myself because the one whose life is so valuable
must go, and the one whose life has no value will
remain. I do not begrudge any one anything, God
knows; but my heart winces when I think that his
soul will go on and leave me alone, while a body that
is the same as his will live and live for another. I am
brave, I am strong; my higher self has courage and
understanding to cope with any problem that may
come, but it seems as if this one laid me on a rack,
because&mdash;because&mdash;" she stopped, and then in a
low cry: "Lassie, she doesn't seem to me to be worthy
of even his body. Perhaps I misjudge her, but even
the human presentment of such a man should have a
wife of greater caliber. Somehow it hurts me, somehow
everything hurts me to-night. You see, dear, you
were right. In some ways. Yes, you were right."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which Lassie just gently
stroked the hand between her own.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I believe?" Alva continued.<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
"Some crisis is preparing. I don't at all know
what it is, but I feel it coming. I am certain&mdash;confident&mdash;that
God has some new wisdom close in
hand for me. Happy or sad&mdash;it is coming very close
to-night. And whatever it is, I must go bravely forward
to meet it."</p>

<p>Lassie shuddered ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Ah, you think that it is some sorrow," Alva said;
"my dear, would you credit me with telling you the
truth, if I told you that there is a comfort in understanding
that verse about whom He loveth He chasteneth?
He doesn't call upon the weak among His
children to bear what He has sent to me, to us. And
if there is some heavy sorrow,"&mdash;she stopped, and presently
added quite low,&mdash;"'not my will, but Thine be
done!'"</p>

<p>Lassie was deeply touched. She felt tears rolling
down her cheeks. The dusk had closed in and she
could not see Alva's face, but she felt that she, too, was
weeping.</p>

<p>Presently a freight train, going by, drowned everything
by its roaring clank for five minutes, and when
all was still again, Alva said: "Come, let us dress for
supper!"</p>

<p>She rose at once and lit the light, and Lassie saw with
astonishment that she was smiling and bright as usual.
Alva caught her surprised look. "I'm a creature of
strong belief, dear," she said, laughing, "and I know
that whatever is hard, is worth itself. That is what one
must try never to forget. I wouldn't wish any one else
my life to live, but it is its own reward. The best
thing in the world is to measure the real standards of
earth and heaven. That is what I am doing."<span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>"Don't you think perhaps you're overdoing, Alva?"
the girl said, putting the question in the way of timid
suggestion. "Don't you think you crowd even yourself
too fast?"</p>

<p>"Can any one learn to be good too fast? And then
the great strain is for such a little while, dear. Don't
you see that in the world's eyes my giving will be limited
to these few weeks, and that in heaven's eyes I shall
then give all that I have and all that I am. Like him,
I have pawned my existence for a purpose. I shall
redeem both." The look of ecstasy that had opened to
Lassie the gate of Medieval faith, flooded her face.
"What a life I shall live in those few brief days," she
said, softly; "how we shall enjoy our little oasis of
bliss in the desert of loneliness. I shall learn so much&mdash;so
much. And the best of the learning will be that I
shall learn it from him."</p>

<p>Lassie watched the uplifted look. The enthusiasm
of the novice was hers. As she had confessed to Ingram,
envy dwelt at her heart. I wonder whether envy
is a vice or a virtue when it stirs a longing to emulate
one whom we recognize as better than ourselves?<span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h3">DEVOTED TO COATS AND CASE-KNIVES</p>

<p>"'He moves in a mysterious way His wonders
to perform,'" chanted Mrs. Ray, briskly,
turning from the stove, with a hot iron in her hand,
towards the visitor then entering the door. "Yes,
I'm just pressing the seams. The mail was awful late&mdash;they
had a bad wreck on the road, killed three pigs&mdash;and
the crowd is just gone. When the mail's late I'm
always late, too. Yes, indeed. Those two in love come
up for the hotel mail, while that poor, blind thing went
over alone to look at what she fondly supposes is going
to be her happy home. Take a chair. How's Lottie
Ann? And, Mrs. Wiley, what do you think about those
case-knives in the bureau drawer?" for the case-knives
were now the main topic of conversation all
over Ledge and its attendant villages.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley had dropped in to see how her new winter
jacket, now in process of active manufacture, was getting
on. She sank down on a seat with a sigh which the
chair echoed in a groan.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know what to do," she said, wearily.
"Uncle Purchase came yesterday for a week, driving
his colts, and last night one of the colts had colic; and
Lottie Ann gets thinner every day. Seems like I do
have so much trouble. Sister Anna got so tired with
the improvements she's making, that she just up and<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
off for Buffalo Wednesday, and that left Eliza to run
things; and Eliza up and bit a chestnut and broke two
teeth, so she had to go off to Rochester yesterday early.
That leaves me with the whole thing now, and I'm
running back and forth between houses from dawn to
dark. I wanted to make the dress for Cousin Dolly's
graduation, too, and the sewing machine always does
for my legs; and yesterday here come Uncle Purchase!"</p>

<p>"Joey Beall is all used up over those case-knives,"
said Mrs. Ray, pressing assiduously; "he won't say
what he thinks."</p>

<p>"How's it getting on?" asked Mrs. Wiley, hitching
her chair nearer to the ironing-board. "Oh, Mrs.
Ray, you'll never know the sacred feelings this coat
will give me in church. Father was a true Christian,
I always have that to remember. He had his faults,
but he was a true Christian. Whatever went through
his hands in the week, it was the plate at church that
they held on Sunday."</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry over your father, Mrs.
Wiley," said Mrs. Ray; "nobody doubted his religion&mdash;it
was only that he charged such awful interest."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley sighed. "I know," she said; "it wasn't
so much what he charged as bothered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Ray, "it was his way of insisting
on being paid."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley sighed again.</p>

<p>"Well, thanks to the braid, the land is saved,"
Mrs. Ray went on cheerfully. "Mrs. Wiley, do tell
me, what do you think of all this at the O'Neil House,&mdash;and
did you bring the buttons?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you said you could use the buttons
on the suit," Mrs. Wiley answered, with an unhappy<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
start; "you ain't going to tell me that you can't, are
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," said Mrs. Ray, "it's only that it's so
common for folks to forget to bring me their buttons
that I forgot that you had brought yours. It's awful,
isn't it, about those two Lathbuns?"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd lost 'em by accident," said Mrs.
Wiley, seating herself again with a huge relief; "I
don't know what I'd of done if you had, for my money
is all in the chickens, and I never saw anything like
the way my chickens have acted lately. I wondered
if it could be that the surveyors upset them. They
haven't been a bit regular, and so many weasels!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the surveyors keep the weasels stirred up.
I must say it would stir me up to have the sharp end of
one of their little flags suddenly driven into the bosom
of my family. Not but what a flag is better than a case-knife.
You've heard about the case-knives, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard about the case-knives. Mrs. Ray,
don't you want me to try it on? What do you think
they had 'em for, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; you might on account of the
sleeves, maybe. I don't know what to think&mdash;of
course they never got any mail; when any one never
gets any mail, it blocks my observation in all directions.
I never saw any strangers that stayed so long, that never
got any mail before. Why, those other girls are getting
letters by the dozens. Such nice mail, too,&mdash;thick
white paper and thin blue paper, and little prints of
flags, such real, pretty mail. There, what do you think
of that,&mdash;that's your back; like it?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I get out my glasses. But of course they
must of bought postals, didn't they? Mrs. Ray, you<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
have done that fine! You're the only one in the world
that could ever fit me like that out of a suit of father's.
I take such a number of under-the-arm pieces."</p>

<p>"Well, that isn't your fault, Mrs. Wiley; you come
of a large family and you ought to be very grateful,
because if you hadn't you'd never have had this jacket.
If there hadn't been close on to two full breadths in
each of his legs, I never could have got it out. There's
nothing takes more skill than making a man's clothes
over for any one but a boy. Yes, indeed. Very few
can think how difficult it is to adapt a man's legs with
the knees bagged, to either the front or back of a coat
for you. No, they never even bought postals. They
never write at all. What would they write with? You
can't write with a case-knife."</p>

<p>"No, that's so. I must say I think you've put that
braid on beautiful. Do you want me to slip it on now,
or shall I wait? Uncle Purchase is up at the house
always, you know, and I mustn't be gone too long, but
Lottie Ann's there, so it don't matter much, after all."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready in a second. I'd be further along,
only Sammy Adams was in last evening, and he hates
to see me sew every minute. I sewed a good deal of
his visit&mdash;I don't know why I should consider Sammy
Adams's ideas when he don't consider mine. Taking
in any one nights that way! I tell you I had that out
with him once for all. There,&mdash;that's your pocket;
big enough?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't make it any bigger. What did
he tell you about his taking 'em in? Mrs. Ray, I took
your advice and tried milk on Lottie Ann, and she
can't take any but buttermilk. Will that do her as
much good as milk in its first?"<span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>"I don't know why it shouldn't. I tell you frankly,
Mrs. Wiley, you'll need every inch of the room in this
pocket. You may have your prayer-book and a box of
peppermint, and two or three other little things, and
you'll find this pocket very handy; the way I've got
it cut it'll hold as much as a small valise. I wouldn't cut
it off, if it was my coat. I always need all my pockets.
But then I always have to carry so many things, a
corkscrew and a monkey-wrench and the key to my
hens. He said the rain was pouring down, and he didn't
see anything to do but take them in. Of course, if
you're Sammy's easy kind, and it's raining, too, you can
see how that would be. He'd take a snake in, if it asked
him with a smile."</p>

<p>"What do you think of cutting off about a half
inch? I don't wonder that he took them in, myself.
But, Mrs. Ray, she don't like milk, anyhow, and
shouldn't you think morning and night was enough?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it if you say so, of course, Mrs. Wiley. But
I can't see myself cutting them off, if they were mine.
Of course, two glasses is better than none, but two
isn't six. I only know if it was me I'd never of let them
in, in this world."</p>

<p>"I'll try to get her to take four. Shall I slip it on
now? Do tell me what else he said?"</p>

<p>"If she was my girl, I'd see she took what I told her;
I don't believe in spoiling children. No, you'll have to
wait. Why, Mrs. Wiley, would you believe that that
poor innocent didn't know a thing about the case-knives
till I told him. You know he don't often come
to town."</p>

<p>"Well, I never! I told Uncle Purchase all about it,
and he promised me he'd never take any one in. I<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
thought I'd better be on the safe side, even if Uncle
Purchase hasn't let any one come into his house for
twenty years. Isn't it strange? But then Uncle Purchase
is strange. The last time I was in his house
was when Abner was a baby. He had a dozen tissue-paper
hyacinths planted in real pots with the earth
watered, to make them look real. Uncle Purchase's
quite a character."</p>

<p>"Sammy said they rapped&mdash;that was how he came
to first know that they were at the door."</p>

<p>"Uncle Purchase never goes to the door. He's so
deaf he couldn't hear a peal of thunder if it stood outside
rapping all night, and that last time I was there he
had his trunk all packed standing in the hall. He never
unpacked it after he went to the Centennial. He said
it would be all ready for the next Centennial. They
have them so often now, you know. He's so odd. He
went to the Insane Asylum once for a little while,
you know, but it didn't do him a bit of good, so he came
back home. Uncle Purchase is so odd."</p>

<p>"Sammy said they were a sight. He said two
drowned rats washed up by a spring flood would be dry
and slick beside them. Sammy always did talk just
like a poet. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Uncle Purchase says very pretty things, too. He's
so loving to Lottie Ann, he said yesterday she winged
her way about the house like an angel. I thought that
was a sweet way of putting it, but it kind of depressed
me, too, she's so awful thin. Shall I slip it on now?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Don't you think maybe he just meant a
fly? The last ones go so slow that they might make
him think of an angel."</p>

<p>"No, he meant Lottie Ann. Uncle Purchase always<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
says what he means. He brought Lottie Ann a daguerreotype
of his mother. It's so black you can't see
a thing, but it showed his kindness. I thought Lottie
Ann would bring the chimney down trying to thank
him&mdash;he's so awful deaf. He thought she was asking
who it was, and he just roared about it's being his
mother, until I called Lottie Ann for her milk. He's
always been so fond of Lottie Ann. If she outlives
him, I'm most sure he'll leave her the farm. I wish
she'd drink more milk."</p>

<p>"I was speaking about her to Nathan and Lizzie
when they were up yesterday. You know Lizzie was
delicate, too. Nathan thinks the Lathbuns had those
knives to pry open windows."</p>

<p>"Oh, my heavens!"</p>

<p>"He says you can pry open any window-catch with a
case-knife. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley opened her eyes. "Any window?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what he said. And poor Clay Wright
Benton was in here, too, and I spoke to him about
them, too, and he said that you could, too."</p>

<p>"My!" Mrs. Wiley's tone was appalled. "Did
Clay seem frightened? I suppose they aren't afraid
of anything,&mdash;they've got the parrot, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't know how that would help them. It
hangs upside down, yelling 'Fire, Fire,' rainy days,
until nobody can possibly think it means it."</p>

<p>"Well, but it wouldn't make any difference what
it said, would it, if it woke them?"</p>

<p>"But they're so tired being woke, it can't wake
'em any more. Clay says nothing wakes 'em now.
Even Gran'ma Benton falls asleep while it's calling
her names."<span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mrs. Wiley, seriously. "I wouldn't
care about having one for myself. I never let the
children call names, and I just couldn't be called names
by a parrot."</p>

<p>"Clay says his mother don't like it. She's tried
to teach it Bible verses. But names are so much
easier. Bible verses are so long. And they don't
come in where they make sense. The short ones
are worse yet. There's 'Jesus wept'&mdash;that's the
shortest verse in the Bible, and that never would make
sense. The parrot says 'Twenty-three,' and that
always makes sense. This world is meant to go wrong,
seems to me. Case-knives just swim along without
paying board, while an honest woman has to scrub
her church once a week on her knees and labor like a
heathen Chinese in between times."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Ray, what are we coming to?"</p>

<p>"I told Edward Griggs what Nathan said, but
Edward thinks they're government spies sent out to
keep track of the surveyors, and they have the knives
to dig with."</p>

<p>"To dig with!" Mrs. Wiley was full of amazement.</p>

<p>"You know they do scour the country pretty freely,
and that would account for one being broke."</p>

<p>"There's more strength in a broke knife than in
one that isn't, of course. Government spies!"</p>

<p>"It would account for a lot of things. Edward
Griggs is a pretty smart man; he was at the Chautauqua
last year."</p>

<p>"Didn't they used to call them scouts, Mrs. Ray?
Seems to me I've heard of them in the war."</p>

<p>"Oh, they call a spy anything&mdash;spies don't mind
what they're called as long as nobody knows who they<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
really are. If they are government spies, I'm glad to
know it, because they'll be having an eagle eye out in
every government direction. I think I'll wash the post-office
to-morrow, just on the chance. I didn't want to
wash it till after I'd filed my bond. I sort of like to
get my bond off my mind first, and clean up afterwards."</p>

<p>"I'll ask Abner if he's heard anything from Josiah
Bates lately. Joey Beall is going over to Foxtown
to-morrow or next day, and he says his cousin there
married a Cromwell girl; he's going to ask all about
them there. Mrs. Ray, seems like those women must
be something out of the ordinary. It would be too
barefaced never to pay your board, otherwise."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever they are, we'll soon know now.
People are looking them up in all directions. Mrs.
Kendall's got an aunt in Cromwell, and she's written
her about the case-knives. But she says her aunt never
writes letters, so she don't expect to find out much that
way; still, you never can tell."</p>

<p>"Well, Joey may find out a good deal. My cousin
Eliza always says you'll find out all there is to find
out, if you get hold of Joey Beall. Mrs. Ray, can't
I slip it on now? I've <i>got</i> to go back to Uncle Purchase,
Lottie Ann is so weak she won't be able to make him
hear a thing by this time; and if he can't hear, it always
worries him because he's so afraid of growing deaf."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray thoughtfully regarded the jacket. "I'd
like to of got the collar on," she said; "but you can
put it on now, I guess."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley stood up and donned the garment.</p>

<p>"The sleeves are short," said Mrs. Ray; "but
that's fashionable this year. There was no other way,<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
anyhow. I had to get 'em out from the knee down,
and he was short there&mdash;like an elephant."</p>

<p>"How does it look in the back?"</p>

<p>"It's a little short in the back, but nothing to speak
of. You see I had to swing the backs to get the coat
skirts free of his side-seams; it sets very well, considering
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I like it," said Mrs. Wiley; "and I have my
fur to sort of piece it up at the neck, anyway. You
know, Mrs. Ray, if those two women are spies, I should
think they'd wear nightgowns. I shouldn't think
they'd want to attract so much attention, and of course
not wearing nightgowns attracts lots of attention."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray&mdash;having her mouth full of pins&mdash;made
no reply.</p>

<p>"Lucia Cosby thinks they're tramps and nothing
better," Mrs. Wiley continued; "nobody can understand
Jack's keeping them so long."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray continued silent.</p>

<p>"Ellen Scott says she's afraid of them; she thinks
it's so queer they're not having any coats. But Ellen
was always timid. She never got over that time the
boys dressed up like Indians and kidnapped her on
April Fool's Day when she was little."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray stuck in the last pin and freed her mouth.
"Well, all I can say is, we'll soon know now," she said;
"all the wheels in the gods of the mills is turning now,
and in the end the Lathbuns will be ground out exceeding
small I hope and trust and am pretty sure of."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley looked down over herself with an air of
intense satisfaction. "I don't see how you ever got
it out," she repeated with deeply appreciative emphasis.</p>

<p>"You know those are Nellie O'Neil's shawls they<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
wear," Mrs. Ray went on, beginning to unpin the new
winter coat from its owner. "Nellie's an awful idiot
to let them have those shawls; they'll walk off some day,
and leave her without shawls or pay,&mdash;that's the kind
they are. Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Nellie's too good-hearted."</p>

<p>"She and Jack are both too good-hearted."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley went to the door and took hold of the
knob. "Well, I must go now. Lottie Ann will be all
tired out if I stay any longer. And we never leave
Uncle Purchase alone. He always takes the clock to
pieces or does something we can't get together again,
if he's left alone. He asked after Susan Cosby last
night, and I told him she was dead four times and then
I got Lottie Ann and the boys in, and they took turns
telling him she was dead till nine o'clock, and then
Joey brought our mail and we got him to tell him she
was dead, and then all Uncle Purchase said was:
'Is she, indeed? When did she die?' Oh, my
heavens!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you must be going," said Mrs. Ray, "we
may as well part now. The Giffords are coming here
for dinner, and I've got to begin to cook it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley thereupon departed.<span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h3">LEARNING LESSONS</p>

<p>The wide range of standpoints is one of the most
interesting studies in this world. A man on a
hill can look to the horizon in all directions, and wonder
about all the little black specks which he may see
thereon, and all on the horizon can see the little black
speck on the hill and draw their own conclusions as
to what it may be. Ledge thought city people lacking
in intellect because of the way they "took the Falls,"
and the visitors thought the townspeople lacking because
of the way in which they "took the Falls." Mrs. Ray
knew that Ingram and Lassie were in love, and Ingram
and Lassie didn't know it; and Ingram and Lassie
had been told by Mrs. O'Neil that Mrs. Ray would
eventually marry Sammy Adams, while Mrs. Ray herself
not only didn't know that, but had declared herself
to be "dead set" against the proposition. The State
had appointed a commission, and Mr. Ledge was
troubled over its results; and all the while Creation,
in the first of its creating, had settled the outcome of
the commission's task definitely and forever. And so
they all went merrily, blindly forward, Alva, like the
evening star, moving serenely in the centre, almost as
unconscious of her own position in people's eyes as the
evening star is unconscious of telescopes. She was<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
happy in her ideal existence, and always hopeful of
good to come for others. Her aims were high and
true, her sincerity splendid, and Lassie was learning
a great deal&mdash;more than either of them guessed, in
fact. And the second week was now going blithely
forward, while Alva worked and waited, hoping each
hour for the telegram that should summon her to bring
her lover into the haven her love was building. But
the telegram came not.</p>

<p>"Lassie," she said, one noon, as they stood on the
bridge looking down into the tumbling waters below,
"I wonder if I were ever like you, and I wonder if you
will ever be like me!"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"If you will ever be really in love? I can't believe
that very many people really know what love means,&mdash;that
is, in the way that I mean it. If they did, it could
not possibly be a shock to any one to see me doing
what I am going to do. It would seem the only thing
to do."</p>

<p>Lassie made no reply for a little, then she said,
slowly: "When we love, we look forward to life
together generally; that is why people won't understand
you." She hesitated again. "I mean-that seems
to me to be the reason; perhaps I'm wrong."</p>

<p>Alva reflected, too, her eyes upon the autumn glory
flaunting its color over the deep gray shadows before
her. "Even if one puts it all on the material plan,
I should think that the whole world would recognize
by this time that it isn't the man that a woman loves
that fills her soul with ringing joy; it's the way in which
she loves the man. It's herself and the effect of himself
upon her thoughts that counts. It isn't the house,<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
but the life within the house that makes a home, you
know."</p>

<p>Some shy, latent color rose up in Lassie's face.
"I never thought about it in just that way," she said;
"but I suppose it's the truth."</p>

<p>"My dear, it is the truth. Of course it is the truth.
No one to whom sufficient has been revealed can doubt
it. If you can't see it so, it is because you are not yet
old enough to comprehend. When I say 'old enough'
I don't mean the Lassie who is eighteen; I mean the
Lassie who began long before this mass of rock became
even so stable as to be shifting ocean sand. I mean the
Lassie who departed out of God to work in His way
until she shall return to Him in some divine and distant
hereafter."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alva, you do say such queer things!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but you see I <i>know</i> all this. It came to
me through dire hours of need. I've demonstrated
its truth, step by step. Try to grasp the idea."</p>

<p>"Do people ever think you crazy?" The question
came timidly.</p>

<p>"Every one always thinks any one or anything that
they can't understand, crazy. Mrs. Ray thinks me crazy,
and it's very difficult for me not to consider her so."</p>

<p>"Alva!"</p>

<p>"Yes, really."</p>

<p>"I'll try to consider you sane."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, dear." She smiled brightly.
"Oh, Lassie, it's such joy to have you to speak to.
I was so choked and crowded with thoughts before you
came. It was so blessedly good that if I could not stay
with him, I could come to this quiet spot and have the
house and you to help me wait the days away. You see,<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
Lassie, one has to be part body in spite of everything,
and it's so hard to keep your body up to your soul.
Sometimes it seems to me that all of a sudden I am
drawn into a whirlpool and cannot get hold of
anything solid. I don't know just what it is, but I
imagine that I feel as they say the Saxons felt when
they saw the comet flaming in the year of the Conquest,
that something portends. And it seems to me so hard
that I could not have stayed with him. But they
wouldn't hear to that."</p>

<p>Lassie pressed her hand. "I don't wonder at the
way you feel," she said, sympathetically; "there must
be so much that is hard in your mind these days."</p>

<p>"Words are poor to tell what I feel," said her friend;
"that is what binds me to him,&mdash;it is that he and I
do not need to speak. We can feel without translation."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I shall ever be loved like that," Lassie
murmured wistfully, and at her words the delicate
flame illumined her face again.</p>

<p>Alva did not notice; she was looking down into the
cleft beneath, and watching the little river fret itself
into foam and spray.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said suddenly. "Isn't it lovely in
the noon sunlight? Fancy the countless centuries
on centuries that it must have taken the river to cut
itself this path. There was once a great lake on the
other side&mdash;the side above the bridge&mdash;and it is with
the idea of restoring that lake that the State is having
this survey made. The difficulty is that the State isn't
geologist enough to know that the lake's outlet flowed
out there to our left, and that this river is comparatively
a new thing. If they remade the lake, the lake would
be desperately likely to remake its old outlet."<span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>"Would it hurt?"</p>

<p>"Hurt! My dear, it would be another Johnstown
Flood."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Do many know that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; but it wouldn't drown the men who
will own the water-power, so what does it matter to
this world of yours."</p>

<p>"But is that right&mdash;to look at anything in that
horribly selfish way?"</p>

<p>"In what other way do rich financiers look at anything?
But there will come a time when a change will
dawn. Look, dear, down there; see the rainbow
dancing on the spray. Well, that's the way that public
opinion is going to come in among us soon&mdash;in a rainbow
of truth."</p>

<p>"It will be beautiful everywhere then?" Lassie
asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Very beautiful!" Alva stared down upon the
writhing, leaping waters below; "and I shall have
given my all towards the dream's fulfilment. And I
shall have learned from him how to devote my life to
the same great ends that he served. Lassie, when one
comprehends that not happiness but usefulness is the
end to be worked towards, then one begins to see
what living really means."</p>

<p>"How much it is all going to mean to
you!"</p>

<p>"How much? Ah, only he and I can guess at that!
There will be something quite different from all the
imaginings, in our sweet, sad days of work and suffering
and comforting. I dare not try to picture it to myself.
I only think often of how I shall pause here in my walks
to come, and steal a long look over this scene, so as to<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
go home and describe it. He loves beauty and he loves
wood and water."</p>

<p>"You'll go back and forth across the bridge often
then, won't you?"</p>

<p>"When I'm married, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when you're married."</p>

<p>"My dear, fancy what a joy Mrs. Ray will be to us.
I shall go for the mail expressly so as to tell all that Mrs.
Ray said to me when I went for the mail." She paused
and smiled and sighed. "Lassie, I wish I were
strong enough not to mind one thing. I know so well&mdash;so
very well&mdash;just how it will look to every one,&mdash;above
all to my parents, who are to be driven half mad,
even though I shall only ask a few months' freedom,
in return for all my life before and after. I wish that
I might be spared the sharp, keen realization of all
that."</p>

<p>Lassie's eyes sought hers quickly. "But you have
a right to do as you please, Alva."</p>

<p>"Have I, dear? It seems to me sometimes as if I
were the one person who had no right to do as she
pleases, not even in that which concerned her most.
You know that every one thinks that if a woman marries
with a prospect of years of happiness taken or given,
she is justified in going her own way. Any one would
feel that, would understand that view. I never could
have done that, because my life was too heavily loaded
with burdens and responsibilities; and his was the same.
It was because we were so hopeless of happiness for
so long that we do not cavil over the wonder of what
is offered us. Because if it had come in the form that
it comes to others, we must have refused it. It did come
to us in that form, and we did refuse it. It was only<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
when it returned in a guise that the world calls tragic,
that we could accept it for our own."</p>

<p>"Yes, Alva, I understand," her tone was a cry,
almost.</p>

<p>"Lassie, remember one thing, and don't forget it
during any of these hours that we shall spend together.
If I read life by another light than yours, it isn't because
it was natural to my eyes. Once I might have recoiled
even more than you did, when I first told you. God's
best purposes for humanity require that we recoil from
what seems unnatural. But there are exceptions to
all rules, and in return for two human lives freely
offered up on the altar of His world, He gives, sometimes,
a few days of unutterable happiness to their
spirits. Lassie, he was big, he was splendid; you know
all that he was as every one else does. If I had been
young, if I had been ignorant enough to dare to be
selfish, and if he had been young and ignorant enough
not to know how necessary he was to thousands,&mdash;why,
then, we might have been happy in the way that
two people out of a million sometimes are. But we had
gone beyond all that, or else we passed beyond it the
instant we realized; at any rate, we knew too well that
I was bound hand and foot on the wheel of my life
and he was bound on his. We had to set our faces in
opposite directions and go on. Straight ahead. The
world for which we sacrificed ourselves will never
even be grateful. The world could not have understood
why we should make any sacrifice; the world generally
disdains those who do the most for it. Isn't that so?
If you tell any one in these days that your first duty
is to do right by your own soul, and that that means
doing what is best for all other souls, they stare. If<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
I say to you that I could bear to live alone and he could
bear to live alone, because we both knew absolutely
that we had had centuries of one another and should
win eternity united, you'd stare, too."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't quite&mdash;" faltered Lassie.</p>

<p>"Don't try to, dear; only think how it is to him and to
me now, when we are to have this short, this pitifully
short space of time together&mdash;to have to take it in
the face of such an outcry as will be made. When I
creep back into life again, with my heart broken and
my dress black always from then on, I shall be so
notorious, such an object of curiosity for all time to
come, that my friends will prefer not to be seen in
public with me. When I think of my home-going to
tell them, my very soul faints. My father abhors
any form of physical deformity; what he is going to
say to my marrying one who is so maimed and crushed
that he can not use his right hand, I can't think. And
then there is my mother, to whom sentiment and religion
are alike quixotic. What will she say?"</p>

<p>She was silent, and then she suddenly left the rail
and moved on.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, if it could only stay bright like this until
we came back together! But that is impossible. What
we shall see together will be the snow lying softly over
all, and the brown, curving line of the tree-tops and the
pink sunset glow in the west. He will lie in his chair
and I shall sit on a cushion thrown close beside him,
and with that one hand that they have left him pressed
to my face, we shall look out over all the wide, still
world and talk of that future which no one can bar
us out of, except our own two selves. God can say
'Well done, thou good and faithful servant,' but He<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
proves in the saying that the doing and the goodness
and the faith all emanated from the one who served.
Religion is such a grand thing, Lassie; I can't understand
any one with intelligence choosing to be an
atheist. And lately, since I have realized that the real
trinity is two who love and their God, I have been
overcome at the mysticism of what life really means.
Oh, I'm truly very, very happy. As I look over these
hills and valleys, I think how all my life long I shall
be coming back here&mdash;not to weep, but to remember.
I shall be left lonely to a degree that hardly any one
can comprehend, because for me there will be no possible
chance of any earthly consolation; but in another
sense I shall never know grief at all, for I know, with
the absolute knowledge that I have attained to, that
grief like all other finite things is unreal, and that my
happiness is eternal."</p>

<p>They were now on the tracks quite near the hotel.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Mrs. Lathbun got a letter from her
lawyer to-day," Lassie said, changing the subject
suddenly.</p>

<p>They went up the steps and opened the door, and
there in the hall, on her hurried way out to meet them,
was Mrs. O'Neil, her face quite pale with excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, what do you think?" she cried, opening the
door into the dining-room; "come right in here. What
<i>do</i> you think?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" both asked together.</p>

<p>"The biggest surprise you ever got in your life.
They're swindlers!"</p>

<p>Alva stepped in quickly and shut the door. "What?"
she stammered; "who?"</p>

<p>"They're swindlers, both of them! It's all in the<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
Kinnecot paper." She held out a paper which she
had in her hand to Alva. "You can read it; it isn't
a bit of doubt but what it's them."</p>

<p>Alva, turning quite pale, took the paper and read:</p>

<blockquote><p>A PRETTY FOXY PAIR</p>

<p>Two women, claiming to be mother and daughter,
came to the Walker House in this village a few nights
ago and inquired for supper and a night's lodging,
claiming they were very tired, as they had walked over
from Warsaw. Landlord Walker thought it a little
strange that they should have walked over when there
were two railroads that run from that village through
here, but said nothing and gave them supper and furnished
them a room. They remained in their room
until about noon the next day, when they paid their
bill and left, taking the overland route for Ledge, or
in that direction. They registered at the Walker House
as Mrs. Ida M. Lathbun and Miss H. A. Lathbun,
which are the same names given by a pair who had been
spending the summer in the vicinity of Silver Lake and
Perry. As stated above, they came here from Warsaw,
and our esteemed brother editor in that place paid
them the following compliment in a recent issue:</p>

<p>'A woman and daughter who are going from town
to town, boarding in one place until compelled to seek
another because of their inability to pay their board,
have been found to be in this town, coming here
from Perry and Silver Lake, where their record is one
of unpaid bills. They are smart, clever, female tramps,
who have no income and no visible means of support.'</p>

<p>It is said at Silver Lake they stated they were
<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>expecting some money, and would stay at one boarding-place
as long as they could, and when fired out would
settle at another. They finally went to Perry, and, when
compelled to leave there, walked across the country to
Warsaw, stopping at Mr. Samuel Adams's overnight,
while en route.</p>

<p>The older Mrs. Lathbun is said to be an own cousin
of Arthur Rehman, who has been before the public
for one escapade or another for many years. She is
said to have been well-to-do at one time, and is living
in expectations of more money from some relative.
The couple were fairly well dressed and intelligent
looking women.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alva's hand holding the paper fell limply at her side.
She looked at Mrs. O'Neil and Mrs. O'Neil looked at
her; while Mary Cody, who had come in from the
kitchen, and Lassie looked at them both.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?" Mrs. O'Neil
said, finally.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," Alva gasped; "it can't be
true!"</p>

<p>"Just what I said! You know I said that right off,
Mary Cody? But Jack believes it. He's gone to Ledge
Centre to see Mr. Pollock."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Pollock?"</p>

<p>"The lawyer."</p>

<p>"And where are they now?"</p>

<p>"Up-stairs. They never get up till noon, you know."</p>

<p>"How long have they been here?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks and a little over."</p>

<p>"Haven't they paid you anything?"</p>

<p>"Not a cent."<span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>Alva became more distressed. "And the girl is so
delicate, too," she said.</p>

<p>"Delicate! I should think that she was. Every
third day the old lady has all my flat-irons wrapped in
towels to put around her. And then, think of it!
October, and not a coat or a flannel have either of
them got."</p>

<p>A slight shiver ran over Alva.</p>

<p>"You're cold," said Mrs. O'Neil; "come into the
kitchen. Mary Cody, you stand at the door and listen,
for that old lady is a sly one."</p>

<p>Mary Cody stood at the door, and the other three
went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Won't Mrs. Ray be pleased," said Mrs. O'Neil.
"She was down at the church, or I'd have gone right
up to her with the paper. It was she that set every
one after 'em, because she was so crazy over their
staying at the Adams farm that night. She's so jealous
of Sammy."</p>

<p>"Ow!" exclaimed Mary Cody, interrupting; "I
hear the stairs creaking!"</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil grabbed the newspaper and thrust it
back of a clothes basket. The next instant Mrs.
Lathbun, with an empty pitcher in her hand, came in
through the dining-room door.</p>

<p>The large, heavily-built woman, not stout but very
robust in appearance, had on her usual dress, and smiled
pleasantly at them all in greeting.</p>

<p>"Was there any mail?" she asked, going to the stove
and beginning to fill her pitcher from the reservoir
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"No," said Mary Cody; "I went myself."</p>

<p>"Dear me, how annoying," said Mrs. Lathbun;<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
and then, having finished filling her pitcher, she quietly
retired again.</p>

<p>"To think maybe she'll be in the jail at Geneseo
to-morrow!" Mary Cody exclaimed, in an awestruck
whisper.</p>

<p>Alva turned interrogative eyes towards Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack is going to have them arrested," she said.</p>

<p>"Merciful heavens!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it awful? I'm sorry for them, myself."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but suppose there's some mistake?"</p>

<p>"There can't be, Jack says."</p>

<p>Alva shut her eyes and stood still for a few seconds.
"The poor creatures," she said, softly and pitifully,&mdash;then:
"How did you say you came to find out about
it?"</p>

<p>"A man from Kinnecot had the paper in the station,
and Josiah Bates brought him over to our bar this
morning and asked Jack if he could see how folks like
that could get trusted. Jack said yes, he could see, and
then he told the man from Kinnecot that just at present
he was trusting the same people, himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," Alva passed her hand wearily across
her forehead; "it's awful."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it? The man gave him the paper then.
And Jack's first idea was to take it right up-stairs to
them, but then he thought they might skip before he
could have them arrested, so he decided to drive over
and see Mr. Pollock first."</p>

<p>"I can't make it seem true."</p>

<p>"No, I can't, either. Of course they never paid
anything, but they're nice people. I've liked them."</p>

<p>"Then they won't know anything about all this until
they are really arrested?"<span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. O'Neil; "they'll eat dinner just
as calm as they've eaten all their other dinners."</p>

<p>"Come, Lassie," said Alva; "that reminds me that
we must get ready for dinner, ourselves."</p>

<p>"Do you want to take the paper up-stairs with you?"
Mrs. O'Neil asked; "right after dinner I want to take
it up to Mrs. Ray, but you can keep it till then if you
like."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Alva, with her strange, white
smile; "I read it all through."</p>

<p>When they were up-stairs Lassie exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There, now you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>But her friend stopped her with a gesture. "It's
too terrible to talk about," she said, simply. "I must
think earnestly what ought to come next."</p>

<p>Lassie became silent.<span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="h3">THE WALK TO THE LOWER FALLS</p>

<p>"I certainly am going with Mrs. O'Neil when
she carries that paper to the post-office after
dinner," Lassie exclaimed, as soon as they reached their
rooms. "Oh, Alva, this is the most interesting experience
I ever had. I'm just wild. It's such fun!"</p>

<p>Alva came straight to her, laid her two hands on the
girl's shoulders and looked into her face.</p>

<p>"Lassie!" she said, in a tone of appalled meaning,
"Lassie!"</p>

<p>Lassie laughed a little, just a very little. "I didn't
make them bad," she said; "it's just that I enjoy the
fun of the developments."</p>

<p>"The fun!" said Alva, "the fun! When there
isn't anything except tragedy, misery, and shame!"</p>

<p>"But, Alva, if they are that kind of women, isn't it
right that they should be found out?"</p>

<p>Her friend dropped her hands and turned away.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear&mdash;oh, dear," she said, with a sigh that
was almost a moan.</p>

<p>Later they went down to the dining-room. Ingram
had not come that noon, and Mrs. Lathbun and her
daughter were sitting placidly at their table. Alva and
Lassie took their own seats as usual.</p>

<p>There are not many sensations so complexly curious
as to be obliged to eat your dinner within five feet of<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
two ladies who perhaps are to be arrested as soon as
a man who drives a fast horse can get back from Ledge
Centre with the sheriff.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil's criminal code, reinforced by such stray
bits of procedure as she could recollect on short notice,
led to a supposition on her part that the case would
go almost in a bee-line from Mr. Pollock the attorney
to the Geneseo jail. Therefore Mary Cody's eyes were
full of rounded curiosity as she waited at table, and
Lassie could not forbear to glance often at the quiet
and simple-looking pair,&mdash;the mother in her dark
blue print, with its bands of stitched silk, and the
daughter with the red silk front that had so impressed
her from the beginning. Alva could not look at them,&mdash;her
mind was full of devious wondering. Mrs. O'Neil
glanced in from time to time, her pretty face darkened
by vague distress, mixed with some righteous indignation.</p>

<p>The door opened and Ronald Ingram entered. It
was a surprise and a great relief, for of course he knew
nothing and was consequently under no constraint.</p>

<p>Mary Cody rushed to lay a place for him.</p>

<p>"This would be a grand day to walk to the Lower
Falls," he said, as he sat down; "why don't you do it?
You haven't been yet, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," Alva said; "there hasn't ever been time."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go this afternoon, then? I'll go
with you, if you like. I'm free."</p>

<p>"I can't go this afternoon; take Lassie. That will
take care of you both at once."</p>

<p>"I think that would be fine," said Ingram, heartily,
"if Lassie will like to go."</p>

<p>Lassie looked helplessly from Alva to the Lathbun<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
family. "I couldn't go right after dinner," she said,
hesitatingly, and stopped short to meet Alva's eyes.</p>

<p>"Why not?" the latter asked; "wouldn't you like
the walk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should like it very much," Lassie declared,
her face flushing. It seemed to her very cruel that no
such delightful plan had ever been broached before,
when it was only just to-day that she wanted to stay at
home. She looked at Ingram, and the wistful expression
on his face was weighed in the balance against the
thrill to come at the post-office when Mrs. Ray should
read the Kinnecot paper. Such was the effect of the
past week in Ledge upon a very human young girl.</p>

<p>"Why can't you come, too?" Ingram asked
Alva.</p>

<p>Alva lifted her eyes to his, and in the same second
Miss Lathbun at the other table lifted hers, and fixed
them on the other's face.</p>

<p>"I can't this afternoon," she said, very stilly but
decidedly; "I have something that keeps me here."</p>

<p>Lassie looked at her reproachfully. She was going
to stay and hear Mrs. Ray! For the minute Lassie
felt that she could not go herself.</p>

<p>"I think I'll stay with Alva," she said, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Lassie!" Alva exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, come," urged Ingram; "it's such a grand day.
You both ought to go. Come, do."</p>

<p>Alva shook her head. "I've a letter to write,"
she said; "I&mdash;" she stopped. There was a noise
outside. It was Mr. O'Neil, driving up the hill
towards the house! Mary Cody gave an exclamation
in spite of herself, and darted into the kitchen.
Mrs. Lathbun, who faced the window, said calmly:<span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>"Why, there's Mr. O'Neil, just in time for his
dinner."</p>

<p>Alva turned her head, feeling cold, and saw there
was no sheriff with him. Mrs. Ray could be seen
standing out on her back porch, shading her eyes to
make out anything visible. Of course Mrs. Ray did
not know full particulars, but Josiah Bates had been
to Ledge Centre on horseback and had seen the O'Neil
mare hitched in front of Mr. Pollock's. The postmistress
knew that something was up.</p>

<p>Alva drew a breath of relief. The sheriff had not
come back, so they could not be arrested at once. Or
else they could not be arrested at all. There seemed to
be a hush of suspense in the room, but Mr. O'Neil
did not enter to relieve it. Only Mary Cody entered,
and Mary Cody's face was as easy to read as a blank
book.</p>

<p>"Then you'll go?" Ingram asked again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathbun and her daughter rose and went up-stairs,
leaving the other three alone.</p>

<p>"Of course she'll go," Alva answered; "go, dear,
and get your wraps."</p>

<p>Lassie cast one last appealing look towards her, and
then she also left the room.</p>

<p>"Ronald," Alva then said, hurriedly, "Lassie will
tell you what has happened here. I feel confident
that there is some error in it all, but whatever you
think, try to be charitable, merciful. Don't be narrow
in your judgment."</p>

<p>"Are you referring to your own affairs?" he asked
in surprise.</p>

<p>"I am not the only one who craves mercy," she said,
smiling; "there are many others."<span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>"Sharing your views?" he asked, smiling in his
turn.</p>

<p>"Lassie will tell you," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Alva," the man said suddenly, earnestly, "don't
teach her too many ideals. We are mortal, and life
is a real thing."</p>

<p>"I understood that perfectly," she replied; "but
the world is not immortal and immortality is a real
thing, too. A desirable thing, too."</p>

<p>"To be achieved by working on the mortal plane,
remember."</p>

<p>"I have worked all my life upon the mortal plane;
I shall be back there next summer, you know. Yet
Lassie has learned to see only beauty in my immortal
winter to be between."</p>

<p>"Ah, there is your error," said Ingram; "you
expect to live this winter and return to your old life
in the summer. But that's something that you never
will be able to do."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You won't be able to go back next summer."</p>

<p>She looked at him sadly. "But I shall have to go
back next summer," she said; "do not deceive yourself
as to that. And now excuse me, I want to speak to
her before she goes."</p>

<p>She left him and ran up-stairs. Lassie was putting
on the hat that looked to the eyes of Ledge like a
feather duster upside down.</p>

<p>"You're going to stay here and have all the fun,"
she protested; "oh, I'd give anything to see Mrs.
Ray read that paper."</p>

<p>"But I shall not see her."</p>

<p>"You won't see her!"<span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>"No, dear;" then she went and stood at the window
in her favorite posture. "Oh, Lassie," she said, "I
like to hear Mrs. Ray talk and I enjoy the funny things
she says, but do you think that to look on at the hunting
down of these two women is any pleasure for me?
When I know why they are destitute&mdash;why they are
in hiding."</p>

<p>"Alva," cried Lassie, "you don't mean you still
believe that story?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"You're crazy!"</p>

<p>"I expect so. But I still believe the story."</p>

<p>Lassie stood still, staring at her friend's back. Then
she went hastily forward, seized her impetuously in her
arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Oh, little girl," Alva said, turning, "don't you
see that it's charity, and if they really are not what they
pretend to be and if it all really is a lie, it may be long
before charity will cross their path again?"</p>

<p>"Alva," Lassie said, with her little whimsical smile,
"you've taken all that nice, agreeable, aching desire
to go to the post-office and see the paper read, completely
out of me."</p>

<p>"Well, are you sorry for that?"</p>

<p>Lassie lifted her pretty brown eyes. "No," she
said, frankly; "I'm not."</p>

<p>Then she ran down to Ingram and they set forth at
once, for it is a long walk to the Lower Falls.</p>

<p>The day was magnificent. The bright autumn sun
shone on the lines of steel that glinted beside their way
across the bridge, and there was a silvery glisten dancing
in all the world of earth and heaven and in the rainbow
of the mist, too,&mdash;a glisten that bespoke the approach<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
of the Frost King and the further glory soon to be.
The glints of brown and yellow here and there amidst
the red presaged that Nature's festival was daily drawing
nearer to its white close. Ingram, looking ahead
towards the trees that hid the little Colonial house,
wondered and wondered, but was recalled by Lassie's
bursting forth with the whole story of the fresh developments
which they had left behind them.</p>

<p>"Oh, by George," Ingram exclaimed; "I'd like
to have seen Mrs. Ray get the news myself."</p>

<p>Lassie felt herself fall with a crash back into the pit
of ordinary views.</p>

<p>"Would you?" she asked eagerly; "oh, but we
couldn't go back now; Alva would be too disgusted."</p>

<p>"Of course we can't go back now, but we've missed
a lot of fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought it would be fun."</p>

<p>Quite a little pall of gloom fell over both, in the
consideration of what they had missed, and both stared
absent-mindedly up and down the valley, seeing nothing
except the vision of Mrs. Ray perusing the Kinnecot
paper.</p>

<p>"Alva is so serious over everything," Lassie said
presently, with a mournful note in her voice.</p>

<p>"She's too serious," declared Ingram.</p>

<p>"She's looking forward to so much happiness that
she says she can't bear to add even a breath to any
one's misery."</p>

<p>"And she isn't going to have any happiness at
all."</p>

<p>"Don't you think there's any hope?"</p>

<p>"Of course there isn't any hope."</p>

<p>"What will become of that house?"<span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Shall you be here this winter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. I don't know just how
long it will take for the survey."</p>

<p>"But you will be here while they build the dam,
too, won't you? And that will take years. Won't you
live here a long time?"</p>

<p>"The dam is not a fixed fact as yet, you know; far
from it."</p>

<p>"Isn't it? Every one talks as if it were,&mdash;that is,
every one except Alva."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't live in that house, anyway; I
wouldn't live there for anything, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, it would be full of ghosts to me. I'd feel about
it just as you&mdash;" the words died on her lips, as she
suddenly realized how their unconscious phrasing
sounded. It was the first sunburst of the idea to her,
and it stormed her cheeks with pink.</p>

<p>"No," said Ingram, unobserving, "that house would
not affect any one but you or I, in that way; but for
us&mdash;" thereupon he stopped; the idea which had come
over the girl like a sunburst came over the man like
a cloudburst. He was almost scared as he tried to
think what he had said.</p>

<p>"Alva is&mdash;is&mdash;so set against it&mdash;the dam, I
mean," he stammered, hurriedly; "she&mdash;she has&mdash;told
me all her views."</p>

<p>"But she's different," said Lassie, catching her
breath. "I don't know very much, but I know that it
doesn't look just that way to others."</p>

<p>"The ultra-altruistic vaccine is already beginning
to work again," Ingram said, trying to laugh; "but
you must not attack me, you know&mdash;"<span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>"I'm not attacking you," Lassie interposed, hoping
her face would cool soon.</p>

<p>"Because, you see, I am nothing in the world but
a mere ordinary, humble, civil engineer, sent up here
by a commission to see what the situation is in feet and
inches, and sand and gravel. I wholly refuse to take
sides as to the controversy;" he had regained composure
now.</p>

<p>"I suppose that you haven't really anything to say
about it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Nothing except to make a report. That's all."</p>

<p>Both felt relieved to be back on firm, friendly ground,
but both were saturated through and through by the
wonderful new conception of life bred by the accidental
speeches. They did not look at one another, but went
down the steps and along the curving road with a sort
of keyed up determination not to let a single break
come in the flow of language.</p>

<p>"But you must be glad to work on a popular project,"
Lassie said.</p>

<p>"But it isn't altogether popular," Ingram rejoined;
"it's only popular in spots, you see. If every one around
here was as wild as I have seen some people become
when the business threatened their trees or their river,
we might be mobbed."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought that every one wanted it. Alva
said that the difficulty was that all the people who
would do anything to save the Falls were not born
yet."</p>

<p>"She was partly right, but not altogether. The
difficulty is that, with the exception of Mr. Ledge, the
people who are interested in preserving the Falls do
not live here, and the people who will make money<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
by the destruction of the Falls are right on the spot
and own the land."</p>

<p>"Why, you talk as if you didn't want the dam,
either."</p>

<p>"It is no use discussing my views; the dam will be
a great thing. Very possibly there will be no more
Falls, but the high banks will remain&mdash;until commercial
interests demand their quarrying&mdash;and all we can do
is to go with the tide and remember that while man
is destroying in one place, Nature is building in another.
There will always be plenty of wild grandeur somewhere
for those who have the money and leisure to seek
it."</p>

<p>"But Alva says that Mr. Ledge is trying to save
this for those who love beautiful spots, and haven't
time or money to go far."</p>

<p>"America isn't made for such people," said Ingram,
simply.</p>

<p>Lassie thought seriously for a moment, until a glance
from her companion hurried her on to say: "I suppose
that we are too progressive to let anything just go to
waste, and that's what it would be if we let all this
water-power flow unused."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Ingram; "here would be this
great tract of woodland, which might be making eight
or ten men millionaires, and instead of that one man
tries to save it for thousands who never can by any
chance become well-to-do. No wonder the one man
has spent most of his life investigating insane asylums;
he is evidently more than slightly sympathetic with
the weak-minded."</p>

<p>"Are you being sarcastic?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all. I like to look at the Falls, but then<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
I like to look at a big dam, too; and sluice gates always
did seem to me the most interesting wonder in nature."</p>

<p>They were deep in the quiet peace of Ledge Park
by this time, and only the squirrels had eyes and ears
there. (They didn't know about Joey Beall.)</p>

<p>"Oh, how still and lovely!" Lassie exclaimed;
"how almost churchlike."</p>

<p>The broad, evenly graded road wound away before
them, and the double rank of trees followed its course
on either side.</p>

<p>"I used to camp out here summers, when I was a
boy. You've read Cooper's novels?"</p>

<p>"'Deerslayer' and all those? Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Their scene was not so far away from here, you
know; only a few score miles."</p>

<p>"There must be all sorts of stories about here, too?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear tell of the Old White Woman?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"She lived around here. She was stolen by the
Indians and grew up and married one."</p>

<p>"How interesting! I wonder how it would seem to
really love an Indian?" Then Lassie choked&mdash;blushing
furiously at this approach of the painful subject.</p>

<p>"You speak as one who has had a wide experience
with white men." (Ingram felt this to be fearfully
daring.)</p>

<p>"I've never been in love in my life." (Lassie felt
this to be fearfully pointed.)</p>

<p>"How funny," said the man, "neither have I!
Not really in love, you know."</p>

<p>Such thin ice! But the lure of the forest was there,
and the lure of the absence of interruption, too. Lassie
felt very remarkable. This was so delightful! So novel!<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
Better than Mrs. Ray and the Kinnecot paper even.
Why, this was even better than all Alva's love affair.
Ten thousand times better! How stupid she had been.</p>

<p>"How funny!" she said, looking up.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" Ingram asked, quickly.</p>

<p>He seemed quite anxious to know why she thought
it funny that he had never been in love before, and that
was so delightful, too. A big, handsome man anxious
as to what she thought! She felt as wise as if she had
already made her d&eacute;but.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I said it," she answered, laughing;
"it just came to me to say it. Was it silly to
say? If so, please forgive me, because I didn't mean
it."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to forgive," said Ingram; "only
I never expected you to say anything of that sort. You
don't know anything about me and you haven't any
right to judge me." He spoke in quite a vexed, serious
way, and Lassie felt as wise now as if she had made
two d&eacute;buts.</p>

<p>"But you were in love with Alva years ago, you
know," she said.</p>

<p>"I wasn't really in love; I only thought that I
was."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>There followed a silence for a little while. Lassie
was much impressed by the statement just made. Of
course it wouldn't be polite to repeat to Alva, but it
was very interesting to know, oneself. The road ran
sweetly, greenly on before them, all strewn with piney
needles. There was no sound except a little breeze
rustling overhead, and the occasional fall of an acorn
or pine-cone.<span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>"How does Alva's story affect you, now?" the man
asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Differently from at first. When she first told me
what she meant to do, it just pounded in my ears
that he was going to die in that very house over there;
and that they would have to carry him into it just as
they would later carry him out of it. Oh, it did seem so
terrible to think of this winter, and of her, sitting
there beside him,&mdash;so terrible&mdash;so terrible!"</p>

<p>"And doesn't it seem terrible at all to you now?"</p>

<p>"Not in the same way. She has talked to me so
much; she has made me know so much more of her
way of looking at it. You know&mdash;"she hesitated a
little&mdash;"she feels about death so strangely,&mdash;it
doesn't seem to count to her at all. She feels that in
some way he will be always near her; she says that he
promised her not to leave her again."</p>

<p>"Poor Alva!"</p>

<p>"I suppose that he is such a very great man that he
can affect one like that. I am beginning to see what
very different kinds of people there are in the
world."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" Ingram exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Alva says that he is one of the greatest men that
ever lived. She says that to share even a few days of
life with a man who has been a world-force for the
world-betterment, would overpay all the hardship and
loneliness to come."</p>

<p>They emerged into the sunshine just here, and the
roar of the Middle Falls burst upon their ears. The
fence of Mr. Ledge's house-enclosure stretched before
them, and to the right, along the bank, towered two
groups of dark evergreens.<span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>"We can go through here," Ingram said, unlatching
the gate.</p>

<p>So they entered the private grounds and passed
around the simple, pretty home and out upon the road
beyond.</p>

<p>"Everything is as sweet and quiet here as in the
forest," said Lassie.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a beautiful place," Ingram assented.</p>

<p>They went on and entered the wood path that goes
to the Lower Falls.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand one thing," the man said,
suddenly; "if they loved one another so much, why
didn't they marry long ago? If I loved a woman, I
should want to marry her."</p>

<p>Here was the thin ice again&mdash;delight again.</p>

<p>"They never thought of it," Lassie said, revelling
in the sense of danger; "they couldn't. They recognized
other claims."</p>

<p>Ingram walked on for a little, and then he said:
"I suppose that what you say is true, and that with
people like them everything is different from what it
is with you and me."</p>

<p>(You and me!)</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lassie, "Alva doesn't seem to have
minded that his work meant more to him than she did,
and I suppose that he thought it quite right that she
should do her duty unselfishly."</p>

<p>"It makes our view of things seem rather small and
petty&mdash;don't you think? Or shall we call her crazy,
as the world generally does call all such people?"</p>

<p>"I know that she's not crazy," the girl said.</p>

<p>"Shall we have to admit then that she is right in
what she is going to do, and that instead of its being<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
horrible, it is sublime?" He looked at her, and she
raised tear-filled eyes to his. But she was silent.</p>

<p>"I think that we must admit it&mdash;for Alva," he
added; "but not for ourselves."</p>

<p>The girl was silent and her lips trembled. Finally
she said: "I believe that what she said is coming true,
and that I am changing and that you are changing,
too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm changed all the way through," he admitted.</p>

<p>It was a long walk to the Lower Falls, and yet it
was short to them. Very short! But too long to follow
them step by step. It was a beautiful walk, and one
which they were to remember all their lives to come.
It was such a walk as should form a powerful argument
in favor of the preservation of the Falls.<span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="h3">RIGHTEOUS JUSTICE</p>

<p>Leaving Mary Cody to watch over the house, Mrs.
O'Neil, the instant dinner was over, threw something
over her head and hurried to the post-office.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray met her at the door. "What is it?" was
her greeting; "I know it's come out about the case-knives!
Hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"You'll never guess what they are," said Mrs. O'Neil,
entering the house and closing the door behind her.
"Mrs. Ray, they're swindlers!"</p>

<p>"I knew it; I knew it all the time. How did you
find it out?"</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil told her.</p>

<p>"Give me the paper."</p>

<p>The paper was unfolded, but as she unfolded it Mrs.
Dunstall and Pinkie came running in one way, and Mrs.
Wiley rushed panting up the other steps.</p>

<p>"Have you heard?" Mrs. Dunstall cried.</p>

<p>"Heard! I've heard it a dozen ways." Mrs. Ray
was devouring the article as she spoke. "Sit down,"
she said briefly, without looking around.</p>

<p>"They can't be arrested till Saturday," Mrs. O'Neil
said. "There isn't a mite of doubt but what it's them,
but Mr. Pollock told Jack that the law is that he must
give them notice, and then he must let them go before
he can arrest them."<span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>"Why, I never heard the equal," exclaimed Mrs.
Wiley. "I didn't know that you must let anybody
who'd done anything go, ever! What will Uncle Purchase
say to that!"</p>

<p>"Well, if that isn't the greatest I ever heard, either,"
said Mrs. Ray, never ceasing to read; "that's a funny
law. If the United States Government run its business
that way, every one would be skipping out with the
stamps."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Pollock said," broke in Mrs. O'Neil,
"that no matter how big swindlers they were, we
couldn't arrest them until some one whom they'd
swindled swore to the fact."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you swear, then?" interrupted
Mrs. Ray still reading.</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Pollock says they haven't actually
swindled us, till they really leave without paying, you
see," explained Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"Lands!" commented Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Which means," said Mrs. Ray, always reading,
"that the law is that you mustn't try to catch 'em until
after you let 'em go."</p>

<p>"Seems so," said Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"I never hear the beat!" exclaimed Mrs. Ray.
"Why, this paper says they'd been jumping their
board all summer!"</p>

<p>"All summer?" said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Well, I always knew they were no good," said Mrs.
Ray, still reading; "they never got any letters. They
come to the post-office sometimes to try to give themselves
a reputation, but they didn't fool me, for they
never got any letters. I don't misjudge folks if they
don't get many, and if they cancel up good it says just<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
as much for their characters as if they got a lot&mdash;maybe
more, for a lot of letters may be just duns&mdash;but when
there's no income and no outgo, better look out, I say.
Yes, indeed. Do they owe you much, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"About thirty-five dollars," said Mrs. O'Neil; "but
oh, dear! Why, they've made fudge and worn my
shawls and roasted chestnuts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nellie, Nellie," it was a strange voice at the kitchen
door. Everybody looked up to see Mrs. Kendal, almost
purple from rapid walking. "I've just heard! Lucia
Cosby ran down to tell me. We've got a Foxtown
Signal that's got some more about them in. I run right
over to bring it to you. I was sure I'd find you here.
That's why the old lady always wore her rubbers&mdash;her
shoes were clean wore through with walking, skipping
out, all the time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendal sank on a seat, and the Foxtown Signal
was spread out upon the table with the other
paper.</p>

<p>"I thought that was a funny story about the trunks,"
said Mrs. Wiley.</p>

<p>"They've worn the same clothes for three weeks,
to my certain knowledge," said Mrs. O'Neil, "and not
so much as an extra hairpin!"</p>

<p>"And they haven't any toilet things except a hair-brush
that isn't good enough to throw at a cat, and a
mirror that's broken," interposed Mrs. Ray; "you said
so, Nellie, and I saw it, too."</p>

<p>"A broken mirror's bad luck," said Mrs. Wiley;
"I hope you'll see that it's bad luck for you too, Nellie.
Your husband's too soft-hearted to keep a hotel as we
always tell every one who goes there to board."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't soft-hearted this time," said his wife;<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
"he's mad enough to-day, and he says he'll pay for
his own ticket to Geneseo to bear witness against them."</p>

<p>Just here Mrs. Wellston, who lived in the first house
over the hill from the schoolhouse, came rushing in.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just heard!" she panted, "they left a lot of
bills at King's and at Race's Corners, where my sister
Molly lives, they left a board-bill of eighteen dollars!
They're known all over!"</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" Mrs. Ray said, turning
to Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil gasped.</p>

<p>"The man who told Jack told Nathan and Lizzie
that the old woman's husband died in the penitentiary,"
she said. "That's a nice kind of people to have around
your house."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiley gasped this time. Mrs. O'Neil gasped
again.</p>

<p>"Jack said we must tell you all the first thing for
fear she'd try to borrow money of some one. I told him
he was foolish, because if they borrowed money of any
one then they could pay us."</p>

<p>"He was only joking," said Mrs. Ray; "if they paid
you, you wouldn't really take the money, for you'd know
that they must have gotten it from some of us."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you ought to have taken it, I
think," said Mrs. Dunstall solemnly, "and then returned
it to whoever give it to them."</p>

<p>Lottie Ann and Uncle Purchase now arrived to add
to the festivity of the occasion.</p>

<p>"I guess nobody need worry over that pair's paying
anybody any money they get their hands on," observed
Mrs. Ray, fetching a chair for Uncle Purchase. "What
are you going to do about it, when they come down and<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
want to go out to walk next time, Nellie? Give 'em
your shawls the same as usual, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Why, we've got to let 'em go or they can't skip and
make themselves liable to arrest, of course, but the old
lady said she could surely get money by to-morrow, and
Jack has hired a boy to hang around the house and if
they go out, track them."</p>

<p>"My sakes, ain't it interesting?" said Mrs. Dunstall.
"And to think that they're up there this minute and
have no idea of it all."</p>

<p>"I dare say they have been laughing at you all the
time they were off chestnutting our chestnuts," said Mrs.
Wiley. "My husband says if they'd sold all they've
picked up, they could have paid their board honestly."</p>

<p>"But they weren't honest, you see," said Mrs. Ray;
"honest people all get letters, or anyhow they buy
postal cards of the Falls. And you ought to have taken
my word for it when I suspected them, Nellie; those
case-knives ought to have set you on to them."</p>

<p>"Well, well, and us seeing them walking all around
for a fortnight," said Mrs. Dunstall; "and we so
innocent, and they swindlers, and you boarding them
for nothing,&mdash;dear, dear!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Ray, "here's your paper, Nellie;
what will happen next, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, too," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"You'd better all come down about five, and see if
they did go out," said Mrs. O'Neil, with the air of
extending an invitation to a party. "Why, that old
lady told me that she'd been to the Boston Academy
of Music."</p>

<p>"Boston!" said Mrs. Dunstall with a sniff; "they
never saw Boston. Not those two. Not much."<span class="pagenum">[215]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, but they have," said Mrs. O'Neil; "I know
that they have, for I've been there myself, and we
talked about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess Boston has its crooks as well as other
places," said Mrs. Ray, pacifically; "I guess if we can
harbor swindlers and not know it, Boston can, too."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe it," Mrs. O'Neil said again.
"But these papers make me have to; you see, there's
the names, and Hannah Adele, and no paper would
dare to print that if it wasn't true."</p>

<p>"True! Of course it's true," said Mrs. Ray; "I
never would be surprised over anything anybody 'd do
that would wear brown laces in black shoes and go in
out of the rain at a strange house at midnight."</p>

<p>"Did she have brown laces in black shoes?" asked
Lottie Ann, in a tone penetrated with horror.</p>

<p>"She did, and what's more, she pinned herself
together. I see the pins sticking out of her, time and
again, when she come in to stand around and wait for
mail like a honest person would. No man is ever going
to marry a girl who bristles with pins like that,&mdash;it'll
be a job I wouldn't like myself to be the sheriff and
have to arrest her. He'd better look sharp where he
lays his hand on that girl, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Will she really be arrested?" Lottie Ann cried.</p>

<p>"Why, I should hope so," said her mother.</p>

<p>"As a law-abiding citizen yourself, who may take
boarders some day, you wouldn't wish her not to be,
would you?" said Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Lottie Ann; "it seems to me
very&mdash;very terrible to think that two women should go
to jail."</p>

<p>"But they haven't any money, and they're swindlers,"<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
said Mrs. Dunstall; "they belong in jail. That's
why we have jails."</p>

<p>"If they'd had money, they'd have received at
least two or three letters," said Mrs. Ray. "If people
have any money at all, there's always some one who
wants to keep posted as to their health. Yes, indeed.
No, they haven't any money. People that have money
and never get up till noon is generally buying tea and
matches, at any rate, but they didn't even do that. No,
they ain't got any money."</p>

<p>"I couldn't believe it myself at first," repeated Nellie
O'Neil; "and they certainly ate like people that aren't
holding anything back. Two helps of everything, and
didn't she go and take half a loaf of gingerbread up-stairs
yesterday afternoon? As cool as a cucumber."</p>

<p>"They were both cool as cucumbers," said Mrs. Ray;
"that's why they borrowed your shawls all the time, I
guess. Cooler than cucumbers they would have been
without them, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Jack went up and gave the old lady warning right
after dinner," said Mrs. O'Neil. "He only stopped to
just get a bite first."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope he didn't get a bite last, too," said
Mrs. Ray, tucking in the ends of her shawl. "That
pair was too comfortable with you to want to be warned
to leave. Making fudge, indeed! I'm surprised at
you, Nellie; I'd no more think of letting my boarders
make fudge than I would of keeping them for nothing.
You and Jack don't belong in the hotel business. You
can't possibly make boarding people pay, unless you
make them pay for their board."</p>

<p>"No, you can't," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Josiah was driving down to North Ledge yesterday,<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
and he saw them getting over a fence in that direction,"
said Mrs. Wiley, rising. "He said they seemed to be
learning the country by all means, fair or foul."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to seem unfriendly," said Mrs.
Ray; "but I guess you'll all have to go. I found some
ants in my grocery business this morning for the first
time, and while I'm give to understand it's the regular
thing in most grocery businesses, no ant need flatter
himself that it is in mine. I'm going to clean out the
whole of the three shelves this afternoon and sprinkle
borax everywhere where it can't taste. So I must have
this room. I'll be down to-night after mail, Nellie;
good-by."</p>

<p>Thereupon they all departed.<span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="h3">IN THE HOUR OF NEED</p>

<p>In the meantime Alva, left alone in her room, felt
troubled, vastly troubled, by the sorrow and shame
gathering so close to her. The emotions of those near
by affect one keenly attuned, in a degree that the less
sensitive would hardly believe possible.</p>

<p>She went and locked the door after Lassie left, and
going to a chair that happened to stand close to the
bureau, sat down there, leaned her face on her hand
and thought earnestly of the whole matter.</p>

<p>"Why must I trouble so?" she said to herself, presently;
"no one else does," and then she smiled sadly.
"It is because I have set my face in that direction,"
she said; "I have vowed myself to service, just as he
has vowed himself, for the love of God and God in
humanity."</p>

<p>A light tap on her own door sounded, and she started,
crying "Come in," quite forgetting that the door was
locked.</p>

<p>Some one tried the door and then Alva sprang up
and unfastened it. It opened, and Miss Lathbun stood
there in the crack.</p>

<p>"May I come in for a few minutes?" she asked,
pale and with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, come in," Alva said quickly; "come in and sit<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
down." She drew a chair near to the one that she had
been occupying.</p>

<p>"I have come to you on a&mdash;" began the girl, "on
a&mdash;on a&mdash;" she stammered and stopped.</p>

<p>"You are in trouble," Alva said gently; "tell me
all about it."</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you; I have come on purpose
to tell you. You were so kind and friendly the other
day, and I&mdash;I&mdash;wasn't truthful; I didn't tell you
everything."</p>

<p>Alva rested her face on her hand again and looked
straight at her. "Then tell me everything now," she
said.</p>

<p>Miss Lathbun returned her look. "Mr. O'Neil has
just been up to tell Mother that we must pay our bill
here, or leave," she said. "Mother is desperate. She
doesn't know what to do, and I don't know what to do.
I told you so little of the whole story. The truth is
that he is actually driving Mother and me into poverty.
The truth is that I don't know whether he ever really
has thought of marrying me. Mother never has
believed that he has. She doesn't think that he would
put us to such straits if he was honest. Of course she
doesn't know about his watching nights. I can't tell
her. She'd go mad."</p>

<p>Alva contemplated her quietly. "But you love him?"
she said.</p>

<p>Miss Lathbun's eyes filled with tears. "I do love
him, and I believe that he loves me."</p>

<p>"You feel sure of it, don't you?"</p>

<p>The girl looked at her earnestly. "Doesn't one
always know?" she asked.</p>

<p>Alva smiled a little. "One ought to," she assented;<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
"well, then, how can he bear to make your life so
miserable?"</p>

<p>The white girl clasped her delicate hands tightly in
her thin black merino lap. "I don't know," she said,
in a voice almost like a wail; "but oh, we have been
very miserable! We have such little income and it
comes through the lawyer. He sent the lawyer to
Seattle on business in July, and Mamma and I haven't
had any money since. We have gone from place to
place&mdash;we have almost fled from place to place; our
trunks are held for bills; we are penniless, winter is
coming, and&mdash;oh, I don't know what to do; I don't
know what to do!" She bit her lip so as not to cry,
but her pale face worked pitifully.</p>

<p>Alva looked at her in a curiously speculative but
not at all heartless way. "Isn't it strange," she murmured,
"that the resolution that drives one man to any
heights will drive another of the same calibre to any
depths?" She rose and went to her table. "Tell me,"
she said, taking a framed picture from before the
mirror, "is he really like this? You said so before.
Say it again."</p>

<p>Miss Lathbun took the picture in her two hands.
"Oh, yes, yes!" she said, eagerly; "it is the same.
They are just the same."</p>

<p>"What did you say his name was?" Alva asked,
taking the picture from her and restoring it to its place.</p>

<p>Miss Lathbun told her: "Lisle C. Bayard."</p>

<p>Alva sat down again, and rested her chin on her
hand as before. "I wonder how I can really help
you. I am trying to be big enough to see."</p>

<p>Miss Lathbun's lips parted slightly; she looked at her
breathlessly, and held her peace.<span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>"Even if you were lying to me still," Alva said presently,
"I should want just as much to help you. If
you cheated me and laughed at me afterwards, I should
still want to help you. If you are an adventuress and
I succored you, what would count to me would be that
I tried to do right."</p>

<p>She spoke in a strange, meditative manner; Miss
Lathbun continued to watch her, always white, and
whiter.</p>

<p>"I cannot see why you and your mother came into
my life," Alva went on; "but you have come, and I have
been interested in you. Our paths seemed ready to
diverge and yet just now they join again. Do you know,
that a week or so ago I knelt in a church and took two
vows; one was to accept without murmur whatever
life might bring because for the moment I was so superlatively
blessed; the other was to never again pass any
trouble by carelessly. No matter what is brought to
me, I must deal with it as earnestly and justly as I
know how,&mdash;as I shall try to deal with you."</p>

<p>She got up, took a key from the pocket of a coat
hanging on a hook near by, unlocked her trunk, opened
a purse therein, and extracted some bills.</p>

<p>The girl watched her like one fascinated.</p>

<p>Alva came to her side and put the roll in her hands
and closed her fingers over it. "It will settle everything,"
she said; "there, take it, go. Be honest again.
Surprise every one. God be with you."</p>

<p>Hannah Adele looked down at her hand as if in a
dream. "I was going to ask you for a little money,"
she faltered; "but this&mdash;this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Alva, "I knew when you came in.
Now, please don't say any more. Go back to your<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
mother and tell her. I shall not say one word about it,
you can depend upon me."</p>

<p>The girl rose in a blind, stupid kind of way and left
the room. When she was gone, Alva went to the window
for a minute and looked out. The glisten of coming
cold was in the air. The thistles were loosing their
down and it floated on the wind like ethereal snow.
She stood there for a long time. "Something is to be,"
she murmured, "I feel it coming. What is it?"</p>

<p>Then she went to her table, picked up a pen and
wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Lisle C. Bayard</span>,</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;I am acting under an impulse which
I cannot overcome. It may be only a folly, but it is too
strong within me to be resisted.</p>

<p>You may or may not know two ladies of the name
of Lathbun; you may or may not be interested in
them; but if by any chance you are interested in them,
you ought to know that both have been threatened with
terrible trouble. If the story which I have been told
be really true it ought to make you not sorry, but very
glad, to learn that in their hour of stress they found
a friend.</p>

<p>Yours very truly ...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and she signed her full name.</p>

<p>After that she wrote another letter, with full particulars
of the story. And when that letter, too, was
finished, she slipped on her wraps and walked up the
cinder-path to the post-office.</p>

<p>She found Mrs. Ray just in the fevered finale of her
chase after ants.</p>

<p>"Put the letters on the counter," said the postmistress;<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
"I'm standing on the post-box, and the
Republican party is getting one good, useful deed to
its credit this term, anyhow. I tried a soap box and
bu'st through, and I haven't had a worse shock since I
stepped down the wrong side of the step-ladder last
spring, when I was kalsomining for Mrs. Clinch. But
the post-box is as steady as the Bank of England and I
feel as if for this one occasion, at least, my grocery
business was coming out on top. Well, has anything
new come up down your way since noon? Haven't
paid their bill yet, have they?"</p>

<p>"I think they'll pay it," said Alva, smiling.</p>

<p>"Pay it! Those two? Well, not much! You're
from the city and don't get a chance to judge character
like I do, but I tell you every one that is honest has got
to have a change of undershirts, at least. I've heard
of people as turned them hind side before one week, and
inside out the next, but they washed 'em the week after
that, if they had any reputations at all to keep up."</p>

<p>"Do you want to bet with me as to Mrs. Lathbun's
paying her bill, Mrs. Ray?" Alva asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray turned and looked sharply down from her
government perch. "My goodness me," she said,
"you surely ain't been fool enough to lend her money,
have you?"</p>

<p>Alva was too startled to collect herself.</p>

<p>"Well, you deserve to lose it then," said Mrs. Ray,
climbing down abruptly; "see here, it isn't any of my
business, but I'm going to make it my business and
tell you the plain truth, and if you take offence I'll have
done my duty, anyhow. Now you listen to me and
bear in mind that I'm twice your age and have got all
the experience of a postmistress and a farmer, and a<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
sexton and a grocery business and a married woman
and a widow and a stepmother; if you've lent money to
the Lathbuns you're going to lose it, for they're just
what the paper said&mdash;they're a foxy pair and no mistake,
and furthermore, with all the money you're spending
on that house, you'd better be keeping your eyes
open, mark my words."</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">&quot;IF YOU&#39;VE LENT MONEY TO THE LATHBUNS YOU&#39;RE GOING TO LOSE IT.&quot;</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Ray, what makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because I've got eyes of my own," said Mrs. Ray;
"and I've been married too. I've been married and I
walked to the Lower Falls beforehand, too. I saw 'em
come up the road the first day, and I saw 'em going
down it to-day. I'd send her packing, if I was you."</p>

<p>Alva laughed ringingly. "Oh, Mrs. Ray," she exclaimed;
"I'm not going to marry that man, and
besides, let me tell you something else; I haven't <i>lent</i>
any money to the Lathbuns."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray stared fixedly into her face for a long
minute, then she said abruptly: "You tell Nellie not
to send up for mail to-night. I'll bring the letters
down. I'll be out filin' my bond, and I can just as well
bring 'em down. It won't do any good your coming
for 'em, because the post-office will be closed and me
gone, so you couldn't get 'em if you did come."</p>

<p>Alva smiled. "We'll wait at the house," she said,
laying her hand on the door-knob.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray watched her take her departure.</p>

<p>"I'm glad she's give up the man so pleasant," she
said; "and she's give up the money just as pleasant.
Poor thing! She thought she was smart enough to keep
me from seeing how she meant it. As if any one from a
city could fool me!"</p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="h3">DOUBTS</p>

<p>Alva was sitting in her room, her hands clasped
behind her head in her favorite thinking attitude
when Lassie returned from her walk to the Lower
Falls. The face of the older friend wore its habitual
look of far-away absorption as the young girl entered,
but the look was almost rivalled by Lassie's own look&mdash;for
Lassie had returned from the Lower Falls with
what was to be her own private and personal absorption
forever after.</p>

<p>"Had you a pleasant time?" Alva asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was beautiful!" the young girl exclaimed,
"we had such fun, too," she stopped, and hesitated;
then something in the other's face made her ask: "Are
they gone?"</p>

<p>Alva shook her head. "No, dear, they've received
their warning, but they've not gone."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lassie, relieved, "then they won't be
in jail this night, anyway."</p>

<p>"No, nor any other night," Alva said, quietly; "I
shall not let those women suffer shame and humiliation
when a little money can prevent it."</p>

<p>"You are going to pay their bills!"</p>

<p>"No, but I am going to help them pay them."</p>

<p>"You are going to give them money?"</p>

<p>"I have given it."<span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>Lassie stood still in surprise, and yet, even surprised
as she was, there was a perfunctory aspect which had
not been present in the morning.</p>

<p>"And I have written a little letter to the hero of Miss
Lathbun's romance, too."</p>

<p>Lassie came close. "Alva!" she asked, "then you
really believe that there is such a man?"</p>

<p>Alva put out her hand and pulled the girl down upon
her lap. "I do believe it," she said. "I may be deceived
in some ways, but the man is real, I know. As I
said before, one cannot invent that kind of character."</p>

<p>"And you wrote him? What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Only a few simple words. I felt that it was the
right thing to do; I did it for the same reason that I do all
things. Out of the might of my love. If you ever come
to love as I do, you'll understand how wide and deep
one's interest in all love can become&mdash;yes, in all love
and in all things."</p>

<p>Lassie leaned her cheek upon her friend's hair for a
moment and did not speak.</p>

<p>"I know what you're thinking," Alva went on then
(but she did not know, really). "But do you know
what I have been thinking? I have been wondering.
Surely no two people could seem further out of my
realm than these two forlorn women, but I always said
there must be a reason and a strong one, or else they
would not interest me so, and now you see what it was.
They were brought to me to succor, and that is almost
the greatest joy that I know now."</p>

<p>Lassie felt real life slipping from her, just as it always
did when Alva talked. She was silent and thoughtful,
even her new sensation in abeyance for the minute.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
Love was drawing back a step and letting Mercy have
its hour.</p>

<p>"But if they deserved punishment?" she asked
finally, in a timid voice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they do deserve it, but not at my hands.
If I, feeling as I do, suffered them to go down yet deeper
into the pit, I should do a cruel wrong. I can't do such
a wrong, I must do right in so far as I know how,&mdash;and
it's their good luck to have met me just now." She
smiled.</p>

<p>"Alva," said Lassie, kissing her, "that's a very new
view to me. The evil-doers deserve to be punished,
but others ought to be doing good; so on account of
those others and on their account mainly we are taught
forgiveness of sins;" she laughed softly.</p>

<p>Alva opened her eyes. "What a forward leap your
intellect has taken this afternoon," she commented.
"I never dreamed that Ronald was such a Jesuit. Come
now, jump up, we must go down to supper."</p>

<p>"But you'll just tell me what Mrs. Ray said when
she saw the paper."</p>

<p>"My dear, I really haven't asked."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear; then perhaps she took it calmly! Have
you seen her since?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she took this afternoon to clean ants out of
the government precincts. She seemed calm to me."</p>

<p>"Goodness! Then I'm glad that I went."</p>

<p>Alva laughed a little. For some odd reason the
laugh caused Lassie to blush deeply, although the
laugh was absolutely innocent of innuendo.</p>

<p>Down-stairs, Ingram awaited them. At the other
small table Mrs. Lathbun and her daughter sat as
placidly as ever. The long table was full as usual, but<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
there was a keen subtlety of interest abroad which
rendered the conversation there fitful and jerky in the
extreme. The mother and daughter began to feel
uneasy, and before Mary Cody had placed the soup for
the later comers, they rose and went quietly up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Do you know what they said when Mr. O'Neil
gave them warning?" Lassie asked, when the others
had also left the room.</p>

<p>"They said they'd pay the money just as soon as a
letter could get to Cromwell and back," Alva replied.
"They had been waiting for their own lawyer to return
from day to day, but if it came to the question of real
necessity they could get money from some one else."</p>

<p>The squeak of the outside door was heard; it was
Mrs. Ray, and the next second she was in their
midst.</p>

<p>"Good evening," she said briskly.</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice Mrs. O'Neil hurried in
from the kitchen and Mary Cody followed her as far as
the door and stood there, spellbound with eager interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray was out of breath and had her shawl over
her head and her bond under her arm. "I just run
down before the mail to get Jack to sign this and find out
if anything more 's come up. Sammy Adams was in to
see me about five, and he's scared white over their being
swindlers. He says to think of them swindling around
his house all that night long! He's afraid to stay in his
house now, and he's afraid to leave it. He was running
to the window to look out that way all the time. I'm
afraid Sammy's getting mooney. There were days
when Mr. Ray used to be always looking out the window.
Those were always his mooney days."</p>

<p>"Nothing new 's come up," said Mrs. O'Neil; "the<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
old lady took her two cups of coffee same as usual,
didn't she, Mary?"</p>

<p>"She took three to-night," said Mary Cody.</p>

<p>"Loading up to skip," said Mrs. Ray, significantly;
"well, Nellie, where's your husband? He's got to sign
this before I can go back. The United States Government
won't trust me after seventeen years without my
bondsmen are still willing to support their view."</p>

<p>"Jack's in the bar," said his wife; "I'll go and fetch
him."</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Mrs. Ray," Alva begged. Ingram
jumped up and drew out a chair. Mrs. Ray seated
herself.</p>

<p>"Are they up-stairs, Mary?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, went right up after supper," said Mary
Cody.</p>

<p>"I thought they looked troubled," said Lassie.</p>

<p>"Well, they did post a letter, after all," said Mrs.
Ray, turning to Alva. "I never malign any one, so I
wanted to tell you that. They didn't come in and lay
it on the counter, like honest people, but they put it in
that box that the United States Government requires
me to keep nailed up outside and unlock and peek into
twice every day of the year around. Theirs was the
first letter any one ever put in, I guess, because although
folks feel I'm honest enough to be postmistress, they
don't think I'm silly enough to look in that box twice
a day, just because I said I would on my oath. The
boys put June-bugs and garter-snakes in to try if I do;
but I always find 'em before they've quit being lively."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the letter?" Mary Cody
asked.</p>

<p>"Do with it! Don't I have to put any letter into<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
the next mail and lock the bag, no matter what my
feelings are? Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Where was it addressed?" asked Ingram, leaning
back and putting his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"That I can't tell you," said Mrs. Ray; "my oath
keeps my mouth closed on all business connected with
the United States Mail, but I'll tell you what I did do.
I copied the address off, and then I looked through the
little book of post-office regulations and I couldn't
find one word to prevent my bringing you a copy, so
here it is."</p>

<p>She opened her hand as she spoke and showed a
piece of paper. Lassie, who was nearest her, took it
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed disappointedly, "this is the
letter that she told Mr. O'Neil she'd write. It's to
their lawyer. It isn't anything new."</p>

<p>"Well, give it back to me so I can tear it up," said
Mrs. Ray; "I meant to tear it up, anyway. But where
is Mr. O'Neil? I want to get my bond filed. By the
way," she said, turning to Ingram, "you owe me two
cents."</p>

<p>"Two cents!"</p>

<p>"Yes; the stamp come off of one of your letters, and
I put on a new one. I've saved the other for you. It
was a letter addressed to New York. You'll have to
buy some glue if you're ever meaning to get your money's
worth out of that stamp. I licked it good, but it won't
stick. Too many been at it before you and me, I guess.
That's the way with most stamps that won't stick, I
always think."</p>

<p>"Here's the two cents," said Ingram.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Well, every one in town<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
is wondering what the lawyer will answer them. He's
a real man, for Nathan says he got beat for the Legislature
once. But will he send them any money? That's
the question!"</p>

<p>"What do you think?" asked Ingram.</p>

<p>"I can't have any opinion. Any one who's had anything
to do with the Government closes my lips as a
servant to the United States. It was very hard for me
to give up having opinions when I first came into politics,
but I'm so used to it now that I wouldn't feel easy if I
could speak freely any more."</p>

<p>"But if you weren't postmistress what would you
think?" Ingram queried.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't think anything; I'd know they'd skip!
They'll skip to-night; mark my words."</p>

<p>"Oh, but they won't," said Alva, smiling; "they'll
pay their bill&mdash;wait and see."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will wait and see," said Mrs. Ray, darkly.
"I'll wait a long while and see very little. Yes, indeed.
What sticks in my mind is poor Sammy Adams. He
says he's afraid to sleep alone in his house, and he's too
afraid of dogs and cats to have any to watch. He's
going to put two hens in his kitchen to-night and roll
a sofa against the front door. He says he knows every
time the hens stir he'll go most out of his senses. Sammy
says he wasn't meant to live alone."</p>

<p>"What did you say to that?"</p>

<p>"Said it didn't look to me as if he was meant to live
with hens, neither. But where is your husband, Nellie?"
(Mrs. O'Neil had just re-entered the room). "I've got
to get hold of him. I'm in a awful hurry to get home.
There's the mail, and I've got Sally Catt's dress to
finish, too."<span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>"He'll be in in just a minute," said Mrs. O'Neil;
"did Sally decide to line it, after all?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't decide to line it; but she decided to
have me line it, which is more to my point. I'm sure
I'm glad not to be Joey Beall and have to adapt myself
to Sally; but then, if folks are still calling a fellow Joey
after he's forty, I don't know that it matters much who
marries him, and Sally hasn't changed her mind as to
liking the house on the hill since he moved it up on the
hill to please her."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for Joey," said Mrs. O'Neil, warmly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not," said Mrs. Ray. "I'm not sorry
for any one who's a fool. Speaking of fools, if
they don't pay to-morrow, how much longer are you
intending to keep them for nothing? I'd just like to
know that."</p>

<p>"They can't get an answer to the letter before to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>"Huh! So you're going to feed them all day to-morrow,
too! Well, I don't know how you and Jack
keep clothes on your backs the way you go on. I never
saw people like you two. If I ever want to live free, I
know where to come."</p>

<p>"Indeed you do, Mrs. Ray," said Mrs. O'Neil, her
bright eyes filling suddenly; "indeed you do. You
come right down here any day you want to, and you can
stay here till you die. You know I've told you that a
thousand times."</p>

<p>"You're easy," said Mrs. Ray, drawing herself up
with great dignity. "I just believe you mean it, too,
Nellie, and I just suppose if I was to come and borrow a
hundred dollars without witnesses, Jack would be
plenty idiot enough to give it to me, too."<span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>"Well, I should hope so," said his wife; "who'd
he trust sooner?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray looked around the table. "And it's this
sort of people that those two up-stairs are cheating,"
she said; "well, it's a queer world. But if I ain't
signed and witnessed and back up at my house before
long, the United States Government will likely go swearing
out something against me; where <i>is</i> your husband,
Nellie?"</p>

<p>"He said he'd be right in. Mary Cody, you go and
tell him to hurry."</p>

<p>Mary Cody disappeared obediently.</p>

<p>"Joey Beall says you won't have her, long," said
Mrs. Ray, significantly; "he saw her and Edward
Griggs climbing down the bank Sunday. He saw you
two walking to the Lower Falls, too," she added, turning
suddenly on Ingram and Lassie.</p>

<p>The inference fell like a sledge-hammer. Alva
started violently, and looked from one confused face
to the other.</p>

<p>But before any one could say anything Mr. O'Neil
walked into the room.</p>

<p>"Well, there you are at last," said Mrs. Ray. "I
am glad to see you! Here I sit, filing away at my bond
and can't make any headway because you're the first
to sign."</p>

<p>"It's hard to get away from the bar to-night," said
Mr. O'Neil, bringing pen and ink. "They're betting
I never see my money."</p>

<p>"We'll never see it in the world, Jack," said his wife;
"everybody says so."</p>

<p>"Except me," interposed Alva, her eyes on Lassie.</p>

<p>"And you haven't had any experience with swindlers,<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>"
said Mrs. Ray; "that's easy seen. You ain't
any more fit to be trusted with a pair of sharpers than
Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil, or poor Sammy Adams alone in
his house to-night, relying on hens in the hour of need."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," Alva said sighing. She was deeply
shaken by the new conception of what was transpiring
around her, in the discovery of how much might go on
without her ever noticing. Lassie in love with Ingram!
And the girl was not even out yet! What would her
mother say!</p>

<p>"There, there's my name for another year for you,
Mrs. Ray," said Jack O'Neil, pushing the bond towards
its owner.</p>

<p>"And remember, Mrs. Ray," added his wife, laughing,
"remember, if you ever want a place to live or to
borrow any money, you come straight here."</p>

<p>"I'll remember," said Mrs. Ray, rising and adjusting
her shawl. "Well, it's back to duty and the mail-bag,
now. So good night."</p>

<p>She went out and Ingram felt an intolerable longing
to avoid Alva's eyes until she should have had a little
time to think. Lassie shared the feeling; she, too, was
greatly upset by Mrs. Ray's loquacity.</p>

<p>"Let us go out and walk until it's time to get the
letters," the man suggested to the girl. His tone was
curiously imperative, and she welcomed its command
and jumped up quickly to fetch her wraps.</p>

<p>"Ronald," Alva said, gently, then, "she's very
young."</p>

<p>He met her eyes squarely. "I know," he said;
"but I'm not." She said no other word, but sat
silent until they were gone. Mr. O'Neil returned to
the bar at once, and in a minute&mdash;when Alva was<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
alone&mdash;his wife came and sat opposite her. Alva was
supporting her chin on her hands, trying to disentangle
three urgent trains of thought.</p>

<p>"I'll be so glad when they're gone," Mrs. O'Neil
said, with a sigh. "They've worn on me terribly, and
now that I know what they are, it's awful. There's no
possible chance of their being straight any more. They
wear their heels off on the outside, and Mary Cody says
Edward Griggs worked in a shoe store once, and knows
for a fact that that's the sign of dishonesty."</p>

<p>"But have you ever seen their shoes?" Alva asked,
with a slight smile.</p>

<p>"Why, I haven't put anything into the oven without
having to take their heels out first, since they came."</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten." Alva sighed.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil glanced at her quickly.</p>

<p>"You musn't take them so much to heart," she said,
gently. "They could be good if they wanted to."</p>

<p>"It isn't them, altogether," the other replied. Mrs.
O'Neil looked at her in a sort of blind sympathy. She
thought that the youth and sweetness of the young girl
was what weighed so heavily on the young woman
opposite. "But men will be men," she reflected, and
tried to think of something to say, and couldn't.</p>

<p>The evening freight went roaring by.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought it went up before," Alva said.</p>

<p>"I did, too, but that must have been the wrecking-train;
there must be a wreck on the road."</p>

<p>"Let's go out on the bridge!" Alva suggested.
"I feel choked; I want fresh air, and there is a moon."</p>

<p>"Shall I go with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do."</p>

<p>"I'll tell Mary Cody."<span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>While Mrs. O'Neil went for a shawl and to tell Mary
Cody, Alva sought her big cape. Then they went out
together into the frost, for the frost was sharp in the air.</p>

<p>"The woods will soon end being beautiful," the
little woman said.</p>

<p>Alva walked swiftly on and made no reply. In less
than five minutes they stood out over the gorge and
looked down on its matchless glory of silver illuminating
blackest shadow.</p>

<p>"I hope that the dam won't spoil all this," the girl
said suddenly.</p>

<p>"You like to look at it, don't you?" Mrs. O'Neil
said softly.</p>

<p>"Living here on its banks, as you do, I don't believe
you can appreciate it!" Alva exclaimed. "Can it
possibly mean to any one what it does to me, I wonder."</p>

<p>"I think it's pretty and I love so to look at it," said
Mrs. O'Neil in gentlest sympathy.</p>

<p>Alva caught her hand and pressed it hard in both her
own. "Do you know, Mrs. O'Neil, if I were very
happy I should love best to be happy here, and if more
sorrow were to be, I would choose to have that here, too.
I am so close to God when I live in His country."</p>

<p>She took the warm hand that she held and pressed
it close against her heart.</p>

<p>"I wish that every one was so good as you are," Mrs.
O'Neil said, impulsively.</p>

<p>"Every one is better than we give them credit for
being."</p>

<p>"Even those two?"</p>

<p>"Yes, even those two."</p>

<p>"I can't quite believe that," said the little woman.</p>

<p>"Wait and you'll see."<span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>Then they stood quiet, until a cold wind, coming
down the gorge, smote them bitterly.</p>

<p>"We must go in," Alva said, regretfully; "the wind
comes so strongly here."</p>

<p>They turned and were only a few steps on their way
when Alva stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in signs?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>Alva put both hands up to her head. "That cold
wind was a sign," she said, her voice trembling. "Oh,
I feel so strangely. Something strong and fearful is
sweeping into my life to-night."</p>

<p>In her heart she hoped that it was only the shock of
learning that Lassie loved.</p>

<p>But in her soul she knew that it must be something
else. The long strain of the waiting days had worn
anxiety to its sharpest edge. When Truth mercifully
veils itself, Time&mdash;the softener&mdash;wears the veil thin
until at last, when we have gained strength enough to
bear, we have learned to know.<span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="h3">SHIFTING SUNSHINE AND CLOUDS</p>

<p>Ingram and Lassie went out but not on the bridge;
they did not even turn their heads that way.</p>

<p>"Alva says that she can see the gorge even when
it's pitch-dark," Lassie said. "She says she shall see
it plainly to the end of her life, wherever she may be in
the world." She felt quite safe now that they were
alone; she didn't even mind that embarrassing speech
of Mrs. Ray's.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ingram; they went calmly and happily
up the road. He didn't mind the speech either, now.</p>

<p>"Alva and I never walk this way," Lassie said
after a minute. "We always walk the other, except
just a little bit to the post-office, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man again, and they went on, up the
hill.</p>

<p>The peculiar charm of the ordinary mode of
falling in love is that it is so simple; it requires so
little effort, so to speak. If it was harder work, it
might produce bigger results&mdash;results nearer the
millennium than those we are now getting. Perhaps,
however, the results are a lesson to be learned, and we
are still so deep in the primer of that learning, that
love remains the cheapest, easiest, and most common
of all its tasks.<span class="pagenum">[239]</span></p>

<p>Ingram thought Lassie's remarks fascinating, and
she thought his two "Yes's" both clever and original.
They were each thoroughly satisfied with one another,
and were deeply interested each minute. Ingram had
never tramped along a country road in starlight with
this pretty young girl before, and Lassie had never
walked anywhere, with any man, in all her life. It was
not perhaps remarkable that what had happened was
happening. Not at all.</p>

<p>"How fast the time has gone," Lassie said, as they
mounted the Wiley hill; "to think that I have been
here over a week!"</p>

<p>"And to think of all that has happened," said
Ingram.</p>

<p>"I know; isn't it strange?"</p>

<p>"I shall be awfully lonesome after you go."</p>

<p>This sounded so mournful and pathetic that it
brought a lump into her throat and she could not speak
for a minute.</p>

<p>"Alva will go, too," Ingram went on, presently.</p>

<p>"But she'll come back."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so."</p>

<p>They walked over the Wiley hill.</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Lathbun and her daughter won't go
chestnutting any more after to-morrow," Lassie said,
after they passed under the heavy shadows cast by Mrs.
Wiley's huge trees. "I think that we ought to go back
now, the mail will be in."</p>

<p>They turned around to walk back and enjoyed every
step of the way. There is really nothing that lights up
a lack of conversation like being in love.</p>

<p>As they passed the post-office they saw Mrs. Ray
standing on the porch, tucked up in her shawl.<span class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<p>"There was a wreck," she called; "the mail's
late."</p>

<p>"All right!" Ingram called in response.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray watched them vanish out of the light cast
by her open door, and then turned, went inside, and
shut it. "I like that young man," she said to herself;
"he's got a good face. I wish we were as sure of getting
the dam as he is of getting that girl. We need the dam
full as much as he thinks he needs her. It'll bring men
and lots of money to this section, and this section needs
men and money. All we've got around here is women
and land, and women and land can't get very far without
men and money. It's about time we was getting
some show at prosperity. I do wonder how Sammy's
getting along with his hens!"</p>

<p>Arrived at the hotel, Ingram bade Lassie good night
and she went up-stairs, one trembling tumult of tangling
sentiments as to the conversation now to ensue.</p>

<p>Alva's room was dark, but when Lassie whispered
her name at the door, the answer came quickly.</p>

<p>"Is that you, dear? come to me. Lassie, how I
have wanted you!"</p>

<p>Lassie crossed to the bed, from whence the voice
came. She thought she knew why she was wanted,
but she only said: "What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"I am in the grip of an awful fear."</p>

<p>The girl stood still, much startled.</p>

<p>"Alva! What do you mean? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I went out on the bridge for a
minute after you left, and it came blowing down the
gorge&mdash;a wind of horrid presentiment; oh, I am
beside myself, I don't know what to do. There is no
mail to-night&mdash;" she stopped, and Lassie felt that she<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
was weeping. Finally she added: "I ought to have
stayed there at the hospital. I should not have obeyed
his wishes or what the surgeon said. I ought to have
obeyed my own heart. I ought to have stayed with
him!"</p>

<p>The young girl was frightened, silent.</p>

<p>Finally she managed to stammer:</p>

<p>"But you said that he was not conscious&mdash;that it
was not possible for you to stay there&mdash;that no purpose
could be served. Oh, what do you fear? What do you
think may have happened?"</p>

<p>Alva controlled herself and drew Lassie down beside
her upon the bed. "Dear, I don't know; but I do
know that I shall go away to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"To-morrow!"</p>

<p>"I shall, dear. I must see him; I have telegraphed&mdash;"
Again tears choked her.</p>

<p>"You think something has happened?" Lassie
faltered.</p>

<p>"Yes, something warns me. It has come over me
heavily to-night. I must go and face it. What is the
reason of my love, if it seems to fail him when the
strain comes. It shall not fail. They shall not trick
me into failing. Perhaps they are trying to spare me or
shield me, but I'll go to receive the blow. An instant
swept him out of his life-work&mdash;I saw his spirit of
resignation&mdash;I will be resigned, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lassie felt the bed shaken by the fierceness of sobs.
She was dumb, not knowing what to say. The orbit of
Alva's love was so infinitely greater than that of her
own, that the feebler suffered eclipse in that hour. She
saw herself and Ingram completely swept aside, and
was not even conscious of the fact.<span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>"It is my heart that suffers," Alva pressed on after a
minute, "only my heart, Lassie; my soul is strong,
very strong. There is nothing else for my spirit to
learn, but half of my being still suffers; it cannot
remember every second how it was when I knelt beside
him and he told me in whispers that he was content
and that if I loved him I also would be content. I have
tried to be content, I have been content until to-day&mdash;until
to-night. But now, as I lay here in the dark, it
seemed as if content had fled not only me but the whole
universe. I feel as if content had ceased to exist.
Rebellion is in the air. In some strange way I'm sure
that he has abjured resignation and renunciation; I
feel that he is in the throes of something&mdash;he is suffering,
suffering agony; and I want to be with him. I
<i>must</i> be with him! I shall leave to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Lassie trembled; she had never seen any one like
this before.</p>

<p>"When do you want me to go, Alva," she whispered,
presently.</p>

<p>"Could you go to-morrow at four, and I will take the
train the opposite way at eight?"</p>

<p>"I'll be ready; don't mind about me a bit,
dear."</p>

<p>"We must go. Oh, listen to that wind coming down
the gorge; doesn't it sound as if some spirit were in
travail? So sad, so melancholy! Something tremendous
is taking place, and I am far from him while he
endures."</p>

<p>The wind was surely rising, and its moan shook the
window sash.</p>

<p>"I'm going mad," Alva exclaimed, springing from
the bed; "why did I leave him? No matter what they<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
said, I should have stayed there. My place was there.
Oh, I have been cast in so many moulds these last
years; I have taken so many prizes, only to find them
dust in my hands; and now God will not&mdash;must not
take this one from me! I have learned the folly of the
material, I have bent my head beneath the yoke enough
to be spared another lash of the goad. I pray&mdash;oh,
I pray&mdash;that this cup may pass me by."</p>

<p>Lassie sat still, now quite terrified.</p>

<p>Alva paced up and down the little room. "I have
been dragged&mdash;or I have managed to drag myself&mdash;up
one step above the ordinary. I had accepted the
loneliness that comes when one gets where no one else
stands. I learned not to expect companionship. But
we are not the less lonely because we go our way
alone,&mdash;we are not the less lonely. And that same rule
holds all through. Lassie, I tell you, that one does not
crave companionship the less because one chooses to
marry a dying man; one does not crave caresses the
less when one loves as I do." She wrung her hands
miserably. "I'm weak&mdash;weak&mdash;weak! This is the
test and I am failing. I, who have worked so far, am
being carried down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;now&mdash;to-night.
Oh, the struggle, the tragedy, the lesson!
Life's lessons are always so terrible." Then, her
emotions seeming for the moment to exhaust all her
strength, she came back to the bed, and said, with some
approach to calmness:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is that I preached too much to you, dear,
or was too sure of myself. Perhaps my joy was a selfish
joy, or perhaps I did wrong in planning to leave my
parents, even for a little while. Just in proportion as
one rises, so do the subtlety of their problems increase.<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
To love a man whose life was too big for any one to
share unless she could give herself wholly&mdash;that was
hard but I learned that lesson; I would have given my
life wholly. Then to have my duty chain me away from
him&mdash;that was terrible but I accepted that, too. Then
to have him struck down&mdash;I thought that that was the
worst of all, but something held me up through that.
But&mdash;but," she broke out in a wail of absolute, heartbroken
desolation, "but if he is going to leave me
before we&mdash;" and there she stopped short, shivered
violently, and became stilly rigid.</p>

<p>Lassie dared to put her arms about her.</p>

<p>"Why do you think such dreadful things? You
don't know that anything has happened."</p>

<p>Alva drew a long, sharp breath. "But I do know
it," she said; "something has happened. You will
see in the morning. Oh, I would have given up my
life while he was giving up his, and minded it so little;
but to have to give him up! What shall I do?
I wanted those weeks, even if they shrank to days&mdash;to
hours. It seemed to me that we had earned the right
to a little, so little, happiness. The memories would
have given me strength to bear the hereafter. If I
could only be a soul, and a brave one, like him,&mdash;but
to-night I am all heart, all quivering fear." She paused
to control her voice again.</p>

<p>"But, Alva, let me give you back your own speeches
in comfort. How often you've told me how only his
soul counted, and how that was yours for eternity, and
how, because of that, you found yourself equal to all
things. And you've told me, too, dear, how his renunciation,
how his exchange of power, strength and life
<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>for weakness and death&mdash;and all without a murmur&mdash;made
you quite confident that you would never fail,
either."</p>

<p>"Yes," Alva murmured, "yes, I remember, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you said that the way that he ignored his poor,
crushed body and looked straight towards another
future life of fresh labor made you full of courage, too.
You remember."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember." Then she tried to dry her
eyes. "I won't admit that the world has a right to
shudder, and yet I am shuddering myself," she said,
sadly. "I must learn to be braver. I can't fight down
foreboding, but I must be braver. But, dear, I do so
love him&mdash;I have so wanted him&mdash;he is so dear to
me. I have so lived upon the picture of our hours
together. That little house across the river is full of
him for me. I saw him in it well and strong of spirit,
fighting against the desecration of the gorge, and showing
me how I might help on the work when he was gone.
I meant to give him the joy of one more crusade, and one
more victory to his credit. He would have known how to
act, even if his only sympathizers were the poor and
those yet to be born. He understood the claims of the
poor and the unborn; he gave his life for them."</p>

<p>Lassie enfolded her in her tender arms; the little star
was in eclipse, yet even in eclipse it was gathering power
on high. Alva leaned her cheek against the head on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"How I suffer," she murmured. "Lassie, I feel
that I have entered into a maelstrom&mdash;a whirlwind.
I seem to hear a dirge in that wind outside. I must go
to-morrow&mdash;we must go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll go," said Lassie, soothingly.</p>

<p>"It is my heart, just my heart. It is so hard to strike<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
an even balance between the heart and the soul. My
poor, thin, trembling flesh has ruled to-night, truly."</p>

<p>"Let me sleep with you," Lassie pleaded; "let me
hold you fast and love you dearly."</p>

<p>Alva smiled in the dark. "Come, then," she said;
"I fancy that I shall sleep if my hand clasps yours&mdash;and
if I know that we leave to-morrow."</p>

<p>Later, after Lassie had slept thus for some hours, she
was awakened by Alva's rising and going to the window.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear, you are not faint?"</p>

<p>Alva turned, the pale, early sunrise illuminated her
face.</p>

<p>"Some riddle has been solved somewhere, dear,"
she said; "I'm quite calm now. The struggle for him
as well as for me is over."</p>

<p>"Then come back and sleep with my arms tight
round your neck," said the friend, stretching forth
her arms.</p>

<p>Alva came back like an obedient child, crept in close
beside her, and in a few minutes was sleeping as a
child sleeps.</p>

<p>Later, when the real morning came and the real,
enduring wakefulness with it, it was Alva who roused
first again, and, sitting up in bed, put back her hair with
both hands and smiled into her friend's eyes.</p>

<p>"You're all right, now?" Lassie said, joyfully.</p>

<p>"Very right, dear; the crisis is over. Forget last
night. I shall never be like that again."</p>

<p>Lassie turned her face towards the window; looking
out from where she lay she could see the valley one burst
of flame, its wave of color sweeping off afar and the
hoar frost sparkling over all the glory. "I feel as if I
never had seen anything so beautiful in all my life<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
before," the girl exclaimed; "I don't know what it
makes me think of, but it is as if my soul were growing, I
am so happy to see you happy again."</p>

<p>Alva sat there with the white coverlet heaped about
her and smiled. "Thank you, dear," she said, with
simplicity. "I am happy, and last night and this morning
have caused both our souls to grow."</p>

<p>"It's too beautiful!" the girl said, after a long pause;
"the valley is more beautiful than I ever realized
before."</p>

<p>Presently Alva left the bed and went to close the
window. "There's a mist lying low in the valley,"
she said then; "it lies there like an emblem of peace.
Omens are curious. That cold, sad wind last night had
its message, and the morning mist has another. I know
that some change is at hand, but I know that whatever
it is its burden is good. I feel equal to anything this
morning. I feel as if God had come to me in the night
and told me that he was charging Himself with my
care."</p>

<p>Lassie looked at her with freshly awakened
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't look at me that way," she begged; "that
is the very hardest of all&mdash;to have those to whom you
talk regard you as if you were mad."</p>

<p>"But you astonish me so. Last night you were so
frightened."</p>

<p>"Last night some struggle was on, my dear; this
morning it is settled." She stopped and spoke very
slowly. "I think, perhaps, that he knows now that he
can never come to the house," she said, and although
her lips quivered slightly her voice was clear and composed.<span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>"Alva," Lassie cried, in sudden horror, "you think
that he is dead&mdash;that is what you think."</p>

<p>As soon as the words had passed her lips, she was
frightened at her own temerity; but Alva, whose back
was towards her, now turned towards her smiling.</p>

<p>"He is not dead," she said; "he was thinking of me
all last night and this morning. He is not dead. That
I know."</p>

<p>"How can you be sure?"</p>

<p>"When people love as we do, they can be very sure.
I was awfully shaken last night, Lassie; I confess it.
Something big, that we shall know all about later, hung
in the balance and I trembled. But it's settled now."</p>

<p>There came a tap at the door just then, announcing
Mary Cody with their hot water.</p>

<p>"They're still asleep," she said in a whisper; "if the
letter from the lawyer don't come in this morning's
mail, Mr. O'Neil is going to eject them. Only think!"</p>

<p>Naturally this remark gave quite a new turn to the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Unless they pay, you know," Alva reminded Mary
Cody.</p>

<p>"How do you eject people?" Lassie asked, rejoicing
in the cheerfulness of the commonplace. "If
he puts them out the front door and they just walk
around and come into the kitchen, what can any
one do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mary Cody, apparently
thunderstruck at the mental vision of the O'Neil House
besieged by Mrs. and Miss Lathbun, trying to get in
again. "I don't know what we could do. There's
seven doors to this house."</p>

<p>"Will Mr. O'Neil pull them out, or push them out?"<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
Lassie asked further; "or will he just drive them
out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mary Cody; "everybody in
town'll be up at the post-office waiting to see if the letter
from the lawyer comes, I expect. If it doesn't come,
Mr. O'Neil is going to Ledge Centre and get a warrant."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said Lassie.</p>

<p>"You won't get any mail this morning," said Mary
Cody; "there's a wreck on the road. Two coal trucks
and a car of cabbages. There'll be no eastern mail
till noon."</p>

<p>Then Mary Cody went away again.</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange that all this should happen just
during the little time that we're here?" Lassie said;
"it's made it very exciting."</p>

<p>Alva went on brushing her hair.</p>

<p>Lassie looked at her then, and saw that she bore
many traces of her violent emotion of the night before.</p>

<p>"You won't try to go to-day, will you?" she said,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I shall go." Then she turned and looked
straight into the girl's eyes. "I <i>must</i> go," she said;
"something has happened."<span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="h3">THE POST-OFFICE</p>

<p>From 8.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on, the tide of travel in Ledge
always tended towards the post-office, but on the
famous morning when Mrs. Lathbun expected to hear
from her lawyer, the post-office's vicinity resembled
nothing so much as its own appearance upon Election
Day. Every one that ever had received a letter intended
to be there to see if Mrs. Lathbun would get hers.
Long before train time not only the office itself, but
the adjoining rooms and the porch outside, were comfortably
crowded with a pleasantly anticipative collection
of interested observers.</p>

<p>"The United States Government doesn't allow me
to interfere in politics, or I'd come right square out with
my views," said Mrs. Ray, who held public interest
with a tight rein, while awaiting the mail. "My views
may be uninteresting, but I hit enough nails on the head
to box up a good many people a year."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you think?" some one asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything," said Mrs. Ray; "I know!"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know, then?"</p>

<p>"I know that a letter-getter stays a letter-getter, and
the reverse the reverse. Just as I know that case-knives
are suspicious and that picking chestnuts may be a
bunco game as easy as anything else. I've found it
nothing but a bunco game, myself. I've never made<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
my chestnuts pay, just because they were so easy picked
up by other people; and you can't hire boys to do your
nutting for you,&mdash;boys eat up all the profits and most
of the chestnuts into the bargain. Yes, indeed. And
as for those two up at Nellie's&mdash;they'll get no letter.
Wait and see."</p>

<p>"But what will happen to them then?" asked Joey
Beall, aching to discuss the details of the arrest and the
journey to Geneseo.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I can tell you one piece of news,
and it isn't gossip either; it come straight from Nellie
O'Neil herself; she's been here this morning."</p>

<p>"Have they found out anything new?"</p>

<p>"Not about them; but her other two is leaving."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes, going this afternoon." Mrs. Ray folded her
arms and leaned back against the shelves containing
her grocery business.</p>

<p>The sensation caused by this extra and wholly unexpected
bit of news was thorough and sincere. Everybody
looked at everybody else.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunstall pressed forward. "Haven't they
paid, either?" she asked, with horror in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they've paid." Mrs. Ray was quickly
reassuring on this point. "But with them, it's something
else. I don't know for sure just what, but I
guess that eldest one's beginning to see that it's no use
as far as she's concerned; but she'll have to do something
with that house she was fixing up to live in. Sarah
Catt told me she never heard anything so crazy as
building a house to live in while a dam that Mr. Ledge
don't want built is being built. She says her husband
says that dam never will be built. She says Mr. Ledge<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
is very quiet, but he's very sensible and he says there's
quicksands all under us."</p>

<p>This statement caused another flutter of sensation.</p>

<p>"Can't you dam a quicksand? I thought it run just
like water." Thus Joey Beall's fianc&eacute;e from the
back.</p>

<p>"No, you can't," said Pinkie. "I know."</p>

<p>"I'd be sorry to see the dam go," said Mrs. Wiley.
"Cousin Catterwallis Granger looked to see it raise all
the property around here."</p>

<p>"Drown all the property around here, you mean,"
said Mrs. Ray. "I thank heaven it's the Dam Commission
and not me who'll have to adjust all that dam's
going to drown before it gets done. Josiah Bates says
he heard that they'll have to take up all the cemeteries
from here to Cromwell."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Why? Why, because no matter what powers a
commission can hold over the living, no legislature can
find a law for drowning the dead, I guess. They've all
got to be moved and set out in rows again in a new
place. Seems like I never will see the last of Mr. Ray's
two wives! But I shan't have to pay for their new
start in life this time, anyway."</p>

<p>"Where will they put them next, do you suppose?"
said Mrs. Dunstall, referring to the cemeteries&mdash;not
to Mr. Ray's former wives.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll all want to know that," said Mrs. Ray,
turning her head as if she heard the train (the tension
in the room was increasing momentarily,&mdash;so was the
crowd). "I'm sure I wonder what will become of Mr.
Ray. I never could feel that I really was done with him,
and now it seems maybe I ain't. I wish they'd buy my<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
three-cornered cow pasture for a new cemetery. Then
I could cut his grass when I went to milk my cow."</p>

<p>"The dam'll have to pay for the new cemeteries,
won't it?" asked Lucia Cosby in some trepidation.</p>

<p>"The dam'll pay for everything. That's why every
one wants it so bad," said Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Which room have the Lathbuns got?" some one
asked, looking down towards the O'Neil House.</p>

<p>"The end one," said Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>"The curtains are down," said Nathan, elbowing
his way to the window.</p>

<p>"They never get up till noon."</p>

<p>There was a hush,&mdash;sudden but intense. The train
was approaching.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the train," said Mrs. Ray; "well, we'll
soon know now." She tucked her shawl tighter than
ever, and got the key ready.</p>

<p>"Mrs. O'Neil'll be pretty lonesome to-night with
them all gone at once," hazarded a bystander.</p>

<p>"She'll miss those girls," said Mrs. Dunstall; "they're
real nice young ladies, she says. But she won't miss the
Lathbuns."</p>

<p>"We'll miss the Lathbuns," said Mrs. Wiley;
"they've been so interesting to talk about. We've even
got Uncle Purchase to where he knows they live at
Nellie's. I tell you that was work. He's so deaf
now." She sighed.</p>

<p>"I guess it wasn't any worse than what the Bentons
went through with Gran'ma Benton teaching the parrot
when they lived at Nellie's," said Mrs. Ray. "Poor
Clay Wright Benton was in here yesterday to see if I'd
board Gran'ma Benton and the parrot again. He says<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
Sarah says she won't come home till the parrot leaves,
and he's most wild. Gran'ma Benton's been teaching
the parrot to say something new. She says 'Where's
the Lathbuns, Polly?' and the parrot says 'Out chestnutting,'
only it won't say it days. It just says it nights.
And nights it's wild over saying it. Last night no one
in the house got one wink of sleep. Clay sit up till midnight
to ask it where the Lathbuns was, and then
Gran'ma Benton sit up and asked it where they was till
morning. Poor Clay! He says it's too awful how she's
spoiled that parrot. It's afraid of spiders, and it's so
afraid of them at night that they have to keep a night-light
burning so it can see all over whenever it wakes."</p>

<p>"Such doings!" said Mrs. Wiley, in disgust.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Ray. "I'd like to see myself
burning a night-light for a parrot. If it boards with
me, it'll take its spiders just as they come."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Pinkie, with decision.</p>

<p>"Well, we don't need any parrot," said Mrs. Wiley.
"We've got Uncle Purchase. Not but what I'm amused
hearing about the parrot. But then, I've been amused
hearing about the Lathbuns, too," she sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Something else'll come up," said Mrs. Dunstall,
cheerfully, "and you don't really need anything to talk
about while you've got your Uncle Purchase, you
know."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose maybe not," said Mrs. Wiley, and
sighed again.</p>

<p>"Well, thank Heaven," said Mrs. Ray, "I'm never
short of two things,&mdash;work and talk." She began to
finger the key as she spoke, and all ears were at once
strained to listen for the sound of the feet of the bearer
of the mail-bag.<span class="pagenum">[255]</span></p>

<p>Deathly silence reigned. In a few seconds the footsteps
did approach, the gate creaked and then banged.
Mrs. Ray stepped with majestic haste to the window and
called out:</p>

<p>"Wipe your feet!"</p>

<p>The obedience that ensued whetted curiosity to more
ravenous desire than ever. People had lost sight of the
main issue and were all riveted to the single question&mdash;would
Mrs. Lathbun get her letter?</p>

<p>The door opened and Clay Wright Benton came in
with the bag.</p>

<p>"Lay it here," commanded Mrs. Ray, and Clay
Wright Benton laid it there and fell back into the crowd
behind. Mrs. Ray put on her spectacles and adjusted
her shawl. In the intense excitement of the moment,
nobody said a word. The room was as full as it would
hold, and people who had apparently been secreted in
other portions of the house now came pouring in
through the doors connecting therewith. The one window
facing the porch had turned into a mere honey-comb
of faces.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray took up the key. A thrill went around as
she inserted it in the padlock and slowly turned it.
Then she took it out of the padlock and the padlock
out of the lock. She laid key and padlock carefully
aside. "Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,"
as she slowly drew the lengthwise iron from the rings
and laid that aside. A sort of fresh intenseness pervaded
the atmosphere as she opened the mouth of the
bag and inserted her arm. While her arm was in and
her hand was feeling for the mail, a boy sneezed and
every one turned and looked at him witheringly. This
little incident was taken in the same light as the inter-<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>mission
between two numbers of a concert, for all who
were at the doors at once took advantage of it to squeeze
inside. The small room, which had been unpleasantly
full before, was now packed to suffocation. Mrs. Ray
drew out her arm. The interest was mounting each
second. She laid two packages, tied each with United
States Government twine, upon the counter, turned the
bag upside down and shook it. If a pin had fallen out,
any one could have heard it, but nothing fell out. Mrs.
Ray folded the bag carefully and laid it on the floor
behind her. The atmosphere was breathless in every
sense of the word. Mrs. Ray untied the first package,
taking a full minute to pick out the knot. She hung up
the string. The string fell off from where she hung it,
and she picked it up and hung it up a second time, this
time more slowly and carefully. Then she took out the
postmarking machine. A sudden sigh went around;
every one had forgotten the necessity of the postmark.
Mrs. Ray turned the package face down and post-marked
every piece carefully without reading a single
address. Then she turned them over, gave her shawl a
fresh and most careful adjustment, and proceeded to
sort the mail. When it was sorted, she called the roll
of names amidst a hush that was awe-inspiring. The
few who had letters crowded to the fore, received them
and stayed there, greatly to the aggravation of those
who had none, and got shoved to the rear accordingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray now untied the second package, and hung
up that string. Both strings fell off together. She took
up both strings at once, smoothed them out and hung
them up again. They stayed hung this time. Then
she post-marked the second package. It was a never-to-be-forgotten
scene,&mdash;the wrought-up faces, the<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
fixed calm of Mrs. Ray herself. Then she called the
roll for the second batch. Each time a name was read
off, a wave of psychic emotion swept the room. One
has to get into the real true life of the country to appreciate
the tremendous tumulus which gossip had erected
upon which to rear the monument of this moment.
One by one the names were all called; one by one the
pile of letters in Mrs. Ray's hand diminished. When
it came to the last one, and the last one was for Joey
Beall, Joey received it almost as if it were some species
of sacrament.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" some one in the back asked.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Mrs. Ray.</p>

<p>All turned to go. The outburst of pent-up feelings
was tremendous.</p>

<p>"I told you so," Mrs. Ray said over and over again.
"I knew they'd got no letter." The babel all of a sudden
rose into so much noise that it was evident that the
heights to which popular feeling had risen were going
a bit higher yet. The egress from the stifling room
ceased. Nobody knew just what it was, but all became
aware that something fresh had happened.
Nobody knew what had happened, and nobody seemed
able to find out. All that was known was that something
held every one spellbound and motionless in
spite of their individual desire to go on out.</p>

<p>After what seemed a deadlock of long duration but
which was in fact a matter of but a few seconds, it developed
that the trouble arose around the door leading
on to the porch. Then it appeared that while every one
in the post-office was trying to get out by that door, Mary
Cody was trying to get in by the same way, and Mary
Cody was young, strong, and determined.<span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>For a few seconds the battle pressed wildly. Then
Mary Cody won out and entered. She was out of
breath and disheveled.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter?" Joey Beall, who was
nearest, asked; "there's something new down your way,
I'll bet a peanut."</p>

<p>Mary Cody gasped. "Oh, my," she said, "I run
right up to tell you. We've just found out as their
room is empty. They must of skipped in the night."</p>

<p>"Skipped in the night!" cried Mrs. Dunstall.</p>

<p>"Skipped!" cried Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Ray," wailed Mrs. Wiley, "how'll we
ever be able to tell Uncle Purchase!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ray stood forth like a modern Medusa in
her rage.</p>

<p>"I've been expecting it all along," she exclaimed
wrathfully. "I'm a great judge of character, and I
never looked for nothing else. Now, how can they be
arrested? We must catch 'em!"</p>

<p>"If we can catch 'em!" said Josiah Bates.</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> we can catch them!" said Mrs. Ray,&mdash;"if!
Young man, they'll be caught. You wait and see!" She
hastily threw her shawl over her head, and rushed wildly
out with the excited crowd. It is proverbial that there
are times when a common sentiment merges all classes
into one.<span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="h3">AFTERMATH</p>

<p>The excitement broke up into wide-spreading waves.
All divided at once into two distinct parties,&mdash;those
who wanted to discuss the matter further,
and those who were filled with the hunter instinct and
so craved to set off at once in pursuit of "the foxy
pair." Mrs. Ray justly remarked that "they couldn't
possibly get more than twelve hours' start, in just one
night," and as it was incredible to suppose that they
would return in the direction from which they had
originally come, it followed that there was only two-thirds
of the horizon to scour in any case. Elmer Hoskins
and his dog lost no time, but set forth at once.</p>

<p>Mary Cody walked back down the hill telling a
deeply interested circle the story of how, etc. (and that
for the fifth time in ten minutes); another group stood
excitedly on Mrs. Ray's porch; another set off to break
the news to Ledgeville, and still others spread here and
there, after the manner of distracted bees into whose
hive some great and disturbing force has suddenly
penetrated.</p>

<p>"We won't be able to begin to get this in Uncle Purchase's
head for two days, at least," mourned Mrs.
Wiley; "and Uncle Purchase is so awful fond of
knowing things, too."</p>

<p>"They'll never catch them," said Lucia Cosby;<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
"they know all the roads too well. They know every
road there is to know."</p>

<p>"I should think they did!" said Mrs. Dunstall.
"They've not got out of practice walking in this
locality, I can tell you. Josiah Bates was down at the
bottom of the St. Helena hill the other day, and if he
didn't see them there. Oh, they know the roads."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for the girl," said Clay Wright Benton.</p>

<p>"I ain't a bit sorry for her," said Mrs. Ray; "as a
woman who works from before dawn to far on into the
night to make a honest living by eleven different kinds
of sweat on her brow, I ain't a bit sorry for either of
them. And Jack O'Neil ain't going to be sorry for them,
either; he told me last night if they was men, he'd get
hold of 'em and take 'em out behind the wood-pile and
he knew what they'd get. To-day isn't going to alter
<i>his</i> views."</p>

<p>"If I was Mrs. O'Neil, I'd wash that shawl Mrs.
Lathbun wore all the time," said Sarah Catt, one of the
party escorting Mary Cody back to the hotel.</p>

<p>"It's in the tub already," said Mary Cody.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil came running forth to meet them, her
brown eyes shining more than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, but they were a 'foxy pair,'" she exclaimed;
"haven't they gone and left that hair-brush done up
in a paper so that it's 'baggage,' and shows they want
the room held for them till they come back. Oh, they've
got the law at their finger-tips&mdash;those two."</p>

<p>The whole crowd entered the house. Alva and
Lassie, packing in their room, had heard the news ten
minutes earlier from Mrs. O'Neil herself. Lassie had
watched her friend's face curiously, but Alva had too<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
much else pressing upon her to be more than simply saddened.</p>

<p>When Mrs. O'Neil had gone Lassie had said almost
hesitatingly: "They were adventuresses, weren't they,
and Miss Lathbun's romance wasn't true, was it?"</p>

<p>"Let us not judge, even now," said Alva, quietly;
"let us try to hope in some way. After all, what little
things they were in life&mdash;so little, and probably beset
beyond their strength. And such great things are
pressing on me to-day. What do they matter? God
forgive me for saying it."</p>

<p>Lassie was silenced.</p>

<p>When the Eastern mail train arrived about noon,
belated as usual, their packing was quite finished.
Mary Cody brought up the letters. Alva took hers
into her room and a minute later she came to the door.</p>

<p>"Lassie," she said, "there is something here that I
must attend to at once. Go down and have dinner, and
I'll come a little late."</p>

<p>So Lassie went down to dine alone, and found Ingram
waiting for her. She told him that Alva would come in
a little.</p>

<p>"Has she had bad news?" he asked, startled by a
presentiment of immediate sorrow.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," Lassie said; "she didn't
speak so."</p>

<p>But Ingram stayed, distressed. "She has had bad
news," he said; "poor girl&mdash;her tragedy is closing
in fast. I can feel its end, myself."</p>

<p>His eyes went to the window. "Couldn't you go out
with me for just an hour after dinner?" he asked wistfully.
Then he smiled a little. "We can talk about the
dam," he said&mdash;"or help hunt the Lathbuns."<span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>She looked at him and they both knew that she would
go. It was a very simple, almost childish, romance,
theirs&mdash;but its lack of stress made it all the more
alluring to two who were living under the wings of so
much tragedy.</p>

<p>"I'll get my hat," Lassie said, and ran up-stairs.
Alva's door was closed. "I'm lying down, please let
me sleep. It's nothing but my head," she called from
behind it. Lassie slipped on her wraps quickly and ran
down; and they went out towards the Falls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray saw them go from the post-office window.
The excitement having somewhat subsided, she was
now left alone with Joey Beall's fianc&eacute;e, who was there
to try on her wedding dress.</p>

<p>"Such is life," Mrs. Ray commented; "that woman's
pulled her shades down for a nice nap, and off they
skip for a good-by down by the Falls. Oh, my, but
those Falls are a blessing to the young! It's too far
between roots and rocks for children to get down there,
and as soon as anybody's married they never want to
have nothing to do with love-making any more; so
steep romantic places is just made for the only kind
of people that have any reason for wanting to get to
them."</p>

<p>"The Falls is full of meaning for lovers," said
Joey Beall's fianc&eacute;e, sentimentally. "Joey and I never
get tired of them."</p>

<p>"You wait till you're married," said Mrs. Ray;
"you'll find no meaning in climbing up and down
those banks and having Joey jerk your arms out of the
sockets, then. Yes, indeed. They call it tempestuous
affection beforehand, but it comes to a plain jerk in the
end. Life is full of learning."<span class="pagenum">[263]</span></p>

<p>"Gran'ma Benton's learning the parrot a great
deal," said Sarah Catt. "I come by there just now
and she's beginning already to teach it a new sentence.
She says: 'Where are the Lathbuns, now?' and the
parrot's got to learn to say 'Skipped,'&mdash;she's just set
her heart on it."</p>

<p>"I d'n know but what I'm going to end by being
sorry for that parrot," remarked Mrs. Ray, thoughtfully.
"I think Gran'ma Benton's overdoing it a little,
if she means it to keep up with the Lathbuns. You
can force even a parrot beyond its strength. She's made
it nervous, already. She's got to hold its claw all
through every thunderstorm all summer long, and if
a fly gets in its milk, it won't touch either the fly or
the milk, which I call spoiling the parrot&mdash;not to
speak of the fly and the milk, for of course no one
else in a house is going to eat a fly or drink milk that
a parrot won't look at."</p>

<p>"Sarah told me they had to take away all the looking-glasses
every spring, or it cried the whole time it
was moulting&mdash;over its tail feathers, you know,"
said the caller, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, if they come to live here, I shan't spoil it, I
know that," said Mrs. Ray. "I shall be pleasant to it
and I shall be kind, and it can run after me all it likes
and I'll be careful never to step on it for the very simple
reason that I don't want to take the time to clean up
any sort of smashed creature, but it won't have no
night-light here, nor get its claw held when it thunders,
nor have the looking-glasses took down to spare its
feelings. No one ever took a looking-glass down to
spare my feelings, and I can't begin to take them
down to spare a parrot's. Well, Sarah, I guess you can<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
try on now. Wait till I fill up on pins. Oh, my lands
alive, I wish I knew where those foxy Lathbuns are
this minute."</p>

<p>"I guess Mr. Adams'll be glad to know they're
caught," said Sarah Catt; "he's so nervous for fear
they'll stop with him to-night. Joey saw him just after
dinner. He was more scared even than Gran'ma Benton's
parrot in a thunderstorm."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray was thoughtfully putting pins in her mouth.
"There's a great difference between a man's hand and
a parrot's claw," she said with some difficulty. "Yes,
indeed. Even in a thunderstorm."<span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE DARKNESS BEFORE</p>

<p>When Lassie came back from that last walk to
the Falls she went straight up to Alva's room,
and found her lying on the bed, the faint light from
the shaded window throwing a deep shadow upon her
face and form. Her head and shoulders were a little
propped up against the pillows, and her hands were
clasped on her bosom instead of behind her head,
as was her favorite position.</p>

<p>Lassie's eyes were shining and her heart was very
full and happy with the bubbling joy of that bubbling
joyous emotion which Youth in its ingenuous innocence,
ignorance, and arrogance has elected to call "love."
It had come very vividly to both herself and Ingram
during their walk, and instead of discussing Alva's
affairs, they had suddenly become more than ever
keenly alive to their own. Ingram, conscious of good
looks, good health, and a good income, had for some
time faced the position very cheerfully and gratefully;
but Lassie, conscious of no personal advantages at all
equalling those pertaining to her demigod, was, of
course, thrilled through and through. Certainly these
be topsy-turvy days for chivalric standards, but perhaps
a century later, people will quote with reverence from
the stories of grandmother's experiences before grandpapa
was finally secured.<span class="pagenum">[266]</span></p>

<p>Lassie was very happy. She felt sure that nothing
so ideally beautiful and altogether remarkable as
Ingram's speeches during the walk had ever been
heard before. She was not engaged, but she was "as
good as engaged." And before her d&eacute;but, too. Fancy
the faces of the girls when she really announced it!
She would be the first one of the whole set to be married!
Life was nothing but vistas of joy. Ingram was
absolutely going to take the same train that she did at
six o'clock, and go two hours of the way with her. Oh!</p>

<p>And now she was back in Alva's room, standing at
the bedside, looking down at her friend. Something
in the other's lax position made her look more closely
even in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>"Your head is worse?" she asked, startled.</p>

<p>"No, dear," said Alva, and her voice rang strangely&mdash;like
a low toned bell, chiming afar.</p>

<p>"Something has happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" the young girl could not put the question.</p>

<p>Alva did not speak. Lassie felt her heart freezing
harder every instant. It was always so, when one came
within the circle of that greater existence. Part of the
attraction of Ingram was that he was just so ordinarily
human. Alva was never ordinary, and scarcely ever
human. Oh, dear! Her lovely dream seemed suddenly
slipping out to sea before this tremendous, quiet storm
of resistless stress!</p>

<p>"You have had a letter?" she whispered timidly,
at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, and he is dead." Alva spoke quite
steadily.</p>

<p>"Dead!"<span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<p>"I had a letter from his friend&mdash;his doctor&mdash;the
one who wrote for him. You were right in what you
thought. He died last night, in the night, while
I slept. He was unconscious when he died. He
struggled first and suffered&mdash;while I was struggling and
suffering, you remember&mdash;and then he grew still when
I grew still, and then when I slept he slept and began to
die, and while I still slept he died&mdash;that is&mdash;his body
died."</p>

<p>Lassie sank down upon the bed beside her, took the
clasped hands into her own, and burst into bitter tears,
hiding her face in the four hands at once.</p>

<p>After a little Alva spoke again, still in the same low,
ringing voice.</p>

<p>"It came so close that I did believe that it would be,
but there are some dreams that may not be realized on
earth. Mine was such a one."</p>

<p>Lassie lifted her head to look into her face; she was
sufficiently accustomed to the dim light by this time to
be able to see distinctly the pure and noble outlines, the
large, tragic eyes. She felt herself crushed into speechlessness.</p>

<p>"He wrote me himself," Alva continued presently;
"just the merest word. I read it. I read it twice. Then
I sat still for a long, long time. Lassie," she pressed
the girl's hands warmly, "it was good to think that I
had shown my happiness to you, for no one will ever
know that I was ever happy, now. Oh, it was so long
that I sat here, thinking. I told you once, how, in the
first day of my supreme joy, I went into the cathedral
near the hospital and thanked God on my knees for all
the past and made a vow to accept with courage all
that might come to me, in return for that joy. I<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
thought, as I prayed, that I'd go forth and gladly
starve and freeze till I died, if it were the purchase
price of such happiness. I am remembering that hour.
I will not cry out, nor weep, nor say one word. I have
had him; we shall be one again. My desire has always
been only to be worthy him&mdash;to be worthy him&mdash;to be
worthy him! And now I have the chance to prove myself
so; and I will not fail,&mdash;though the heart in my
body burst, my spirit will not fail."</p>

<p>Lassie was still, overawed.</p>

<p>"I had to search to be thankful at first," Alva went
on, "but now I have found something to be very
thankful for. I am so glad that it came before I had
told my mother. She is spared. She will never know.
Every one is spared except him and me, and we are
strong&mdash;we can endure. We have endured. We can
endure again."</p>

<p>"If you only could have gone and been with him!"
wailed the girl, softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I have wished that! You don't know how
I have wished that! It has been sweeping through me
and rending me cruelly, but he did not wish it, or he
would have sent for me. And I have tried never even
to wish anything unless he wished it, too. You know
how I have wished that I might have stayed there with
him. But he begged me to go. They would not let me
stay. I had to yield!"</p>

<p>"Shall you go as you planned, to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, I want to stay here alone for three or
four days, and then go home,&mdash;back to my duty to
my parents, you know. I never meant to leave for
long. Yes," she almost whispered, "I must hurry
back home, forever."<span class="pagenum">[269]</span></p>

<p>"Never to return here?"</p>

<p>"I think, never. I cannot see how or why I should
return."</p>

<p>Lassie's lips quivered. "And your house?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>A long, sad breath passed over lips that did not
quiver. "Ah, yes, my house," she answered softly;
"I thought of going to it this afternoon, and then I
could not. Dear little home nest,&mdash;there are nothing
but happy thoughts there; all my best is there&mdash;unselfish
dreams, devoted hopes, great aims, longings
to make some one and every one glad."</p>

<p>She paused. Lassie leaned close.</p>

<p>"May I lie down beside you, Alva, and put my arms
around you and hold you tightly, dear? It will be
good-by, for you want me to go just the same, I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you must go. What time is it?"</p>

<p>"It's over an hour till the train. Let me hold you
close, dear, I&mdash;I love you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lassie, come; I'll be glad to have you. Your
head will lie on my arm, and I shall like to draw you
near as I might have drawn a little child, had life fallen
out differently long ago."</p>

<p>Lassie crept up on the bed, clasped her arms about
her and tried not to weep.</p>

<p>"You don't mind my talking of him, do you?" the
woman asked, presently. "You know after you go I
shall never have any one again;" her voice wailed
desolate with the last words so that its very sound
caused Lassie's sobs to renew their force.</p>

<p>"I don't mind anything that you want to do, Alva."</p>

<p>"It's storming in upon me what life was to have been.
What does the world know of love? Love is something<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
too great to comprehend. It costs blood and years and
tears. It goes so deep that the very joy in it cuts like a
knife. I knew that I was only to have had him a few
weeks, that I should have to compress all that I felt
for him into them. But what those few weeks would
have meant! When to be quiet together was in itself
all that we asked! When we should have had a library
and a piano, and the gorge to look out over, and one
another to talk to,&mdash;to be with!" She stopped&mdash;her
breath failed her.</p>

<p>There was a pause, as if to let the tide of grief sweep
up and out again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lassie, we had waited so long and hopelessly,"
she went on finally, her sentences short and tense and
broken. "I tried to be so patient. I tried so hard to
do well with the bit of life dealt out to me. As much as
I could, I followed in his path in the giving of my all to
others and neither asking nor expecting for myself. I
hoped nothing for us&mdash;nothing for us! And then I
had to see him stretched out&mdash;crushed&mdash;maimed,
and I had to live still, and smile into his eyes, and tell
him that even that was more than I had deserved.
And then came our dream&mdash;our precious dream&mdash;the
promise of those few, sweet, perfect days! Oh,
but why should I repine? I have been so happy. I
have contemplated the heights, even if it was not given
me to reach them."</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>"Lassie, it is not my soul that is wailing; my soul is
very strong and resolute. He left work undone and
even this afternoon it came to me that that work was
part of him and that in doing it I should do for him.
If we could suffer annihilation in a good cause, we<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
should survive in the cause. If I carry forward all that
he held in heart, I shall continue to be one with him.
I know it. I longed unutterably to be with him, to
make his pain lighter, to share his hours at the last.
I thought a great deal of our happiness, but I thought
also of what he would teach me to do for the world.
Oh, I can believe that he suffered last night. It was
only the edge of the storm that brushed over me, but
I know how <i>I</i> suffered. There are some men who cannot
die, who are too sorely needed; and he was such a
one. He did not want to leave his work."</p>

<p>She stopped, and Lassie felt the tide of grief rise full
and ebb again.</p>

<p>"It wasn't love or marriage as the world understands
it; but it was the supreme self sacrifice that my spirit
cried for in consecration. I thought that I was to be
greatly fitted for a great work."</p>

<p>Lassie whispered: "Perhaps you have been fitted."</p>

<p>"No. No! Heaven ordained that the sacrifice and
the consecration should be greater than I had ever
imagined. It ordained that he should pass away alone
and leave me alone, too; and now it is left me to work
out a new salvation. I try not to doubt, I do trust God
completely. But I cannot see why&mdash;or how! Not
yet. But, at any rate, the worst for me is come. I have
touched bottom. Battle for me is past."</p>

<p>Then she rose from the bed, went to the window and
let up the shade. The night of Nature's world, always
full of potency, calmed her suddenly into another mood.</p>

<p>"It is snowing," she exclaimed; "that means that
rain is falling on new-made graves." She came back
from the window. "Lassie," she said, "my heart is
broken, my future is crushed, and yet I feel <i>so strong</i>!<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
It floods me fresh. I see now that wherever his soul
passed last night, it must have passed in triumph&mdash;gone
on to further work. I shall work, too. That is
the legacy his letter left me&mdash;an intense desire to serve.
How small I am, how great God is; all life's misery
results from setting our little wills in opposition to His
plan for our best. It is borne in upon me clearly; I
recognize the fact well. Now when I leave this room
next time and forever henceforth, so long as I live, I am
willing with my whole soul to do whatever work there
is laid out for me. I feel in my heart that no stumbling
or even ridicule for stumbling can ever again cause me
to falter. I have found Truth. I will be strong."</p>

<p>Lassie looked at her in wonder. The white look of
unearthly radiance which men once knew as "Ecstasy"
was indeed on her face now&mdash;on her pale, sad, worn
face, filling it with a glow of wondrous resolution.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alva!" the girl exclaimed, and then, even as
the exclamation left her lips, she was conscious of an
upleaping of warm, human joy to think of the six
o'clock train and Ingram's companionship. The higher
plane was very high above her yet.</p>

<p>Alva pressed her hands to her eyes and face. "That
was like a lightning flash, dear," she said; "oh, if I
may only live by its light forever after. If only!"
There was a brief silence; then,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must pick up my things, I guess," the girl suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," Alva tried to smile; "yes, you must
pick up your things. That's what life here means."</p>

<p>Lassie slipped into her own room. She was glad that
Alva was quiet and that she could smile upon her again;
it was truly what life meant to her. She was very little<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
yet and very blind, and the angels might have been
smiling meaningly and mercifully at one another over
her pretty, childish head that hour.</p>

<p>But over Alva the Spirits of Heaven might have
wept,&mdash;as they weep for any on earth who fancy that
they have sounded either the depths or the heights of
any design wrought out above.</p>

<p>Above is so far above, and we and all our hopes and
joys and sorrows are so far beneath. So far beneath
that radiant serenity which moves eternally forward in
its fulfilling of the Divine Plan. His Divine Plan for
the uplifting of all that He has made.<span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="h3">DAWN</p>

<p>As the train pulled out, a half hour later, Alva, now
quite steady and serene, waved her hand, and then
turned away so as not to see Lassie, weeping, yet
clinging close to the strong arm thrown before her like
a guard.</p>

<p>"You'll come home with me, my dear," said Mrs.
O'Neil, who had come to the station, too; "you look
a little tired and pale, and I'll help you finish your own
packing, and then you must have some good hot tea
and gingerbread."</p>

<p>Alva laid her hand in the kindly, warm hand of the
other. "Yes, let us go home," she said; "but I'm not
going to-night, so my packing can wait."</p>

<p>"You aren't going! Oh, I am glad. Then you'll
have a little time for rest. You need it." Mrs. O'Neil
was so frankly pleased that Alva was forced to thank
her kindliness in spirit. The racked are so grateful to
a tender touch after their sharpest agony.</p>

<p>They went across the tracks and up the little cinder-path.
Mary Loretta and the cat came running out to
meet them, and Mary Cody had the teakettle boiling.</p>

<p>"She's not going to-night," said Mrs. O'Neil, getting
out the tea and handing it to Mary Cody, who was now
cutting gingerbread. "I'm so glad; it would be so
lonesome without her."<span class="pagenum">[275]</span></p>

<p>Mary Cody assented.</p>

<p>"And those two young people are happy, too," Mrs.
O'Neil said to Alva, in the dining-room a minute
later, "such a nice-looking couple!"</p>

<p>"I hope she'll be happy," said Alva, staring out of
the window as she sat by the table waiting idly. "She
will have everything to make for her happiness now."
Lassie and Ingram had ceased to matter to her. Her
brain could not include them in this hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil's eyes filled as she glanced that way.
The still, quiet face and form by the window had some
tragedy written in every line, although the lips stayed
closed and the bright-faced hostess felt what she could
not know.</p>

<p>"There, my dear, there's the tea; let me pour your
cup," she said. "Do put in some cream just for once,
it's so nourishing; and why, I declare, if here isn't Mrs.
Ray, just in time to have a cup with us!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray had passed the window and now opened
the door and came in. There was an air of strongly
repressed excitement about her.</p>

<p>"So she's gone," she said briskly. "I was peeking
out watching the mail-bag to see that no one else
stuck a letter in the strap on me, and I saw you all
seeing her off. Pretty she is,&mdash;and it's plain to be
seen what's going to happen next, and I'm very glad for
them both."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. O'Neil, smiling; "we're all
that."</p>

<p>"I come down for several reasons," said Mrs. Ray.
"First," she turned to Alva, "there's a letter that come
this morning, and heaven knows how it happened&mdash;with
all my care&mdash;but it slipped under those pesky<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
government scales and I found it when I dusted out this
afternoon. I hope it isn't very important."</p>

<p>Alva took the letter with its typewritten address and
put it in her pocket. "Don't worry, Mrs. Ray," she
said, "Lassie's gone; I'm going very soon; nothing
can matter much now, can it?" She managed to smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Mrs. Ray. "That's
your view because you're going, but I can't say that I
shall feel really settled in my mind till the dam's settled."</p>

<p>"But I thought the quicksand was going to settle
the dam," said Mrs. O'Neil; "somebody said so."</p>

<p>"You can't settle even a quicksand with a legislature,"
said Mrs. Ray; "I guess I know. The United
States Government is a great eye-opener, especially
when you have to tend a post-office according to any new
rules it finds time to have printed and mail you. I've
had four pages of new rules sent me to-day."</p>

<p>"Here's your tea, Mrs. Ray," said Mrs. O'Neil;
"do sit down. Bring some more gingerbread, Mary.
And won't you have a little jam? I've a lot of nice
fresh this-autumn, plum jam."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want any jam," said Mrs. Ray, seating
herself; "but, Nellie, I've been hearing that legally
your husband can't do nothing with the Lathbuns."</p>

<p>"Well, that isn't the worst," said Mrs. O'Neil, her
face clouding considerably; "what do you think I've
up and done? I was so mad I threw that old hair-brush
over into the gorge, and I've thereby made Jack
liable for a suit of damage for breaking into the luggage
a guest leaves without due cause, or else for willful destruction
of personal property belonging to another and
unoffending party who has reposed trust only to be
betrayed. Jack will have to go to the lawyer to-morrow<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
to find out which. Oh, they were slick&mdash;those two.
They've got the law down fine."</p>

<p>"Well, did you know they're caught?" Mrs. Ray
brought this statement forth as the cannon does the
cannon ball.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil jumped in her chair. "Caught? No,
I did not know it. When?"</p>

<p>"They just told me over at the station that they were
arrested about three o'clock. I guess it's true. I hope
so."</p>

<p>"Oh, to think of it," said Mrs. O'Neil, "to think of
them sleeping here last night and in Geneseo to-night!"</p>

<p>"The complaints will come pouring in," said Mrs.
Ray; "everybody has got a bill against 'em. I don't
believe they'll be out of jail in years."</p>

<p>Alva turned her face again to the window. She had
not thought much of the two unfortunate creatures
during the past few hours, and their misery bore in upon
her with a vivid, headlong shock.</p>

<p>"And those case-knives, too," Mrs. Ray continued;
"did they have 'em on, I wonder."</p>

<p>"Oh, the case-knives don't count," said Mrs. O'Neil;
"they were left here by a travelling man. He was
around to-day and asked if it was here that he left them.
I meant to tell you, but dear, dear, I've had so much
to do, seems like."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ray was much taken aback, but quickly recovered
herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, they could have used a hat-pin just as
well. Anyhow, they might have got up in the night and
murdered him some way. Mrs. Lathbun could have
held him while Hannah Adele just stuck anything
handy into him in every direction. I never could see<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
what they had the case-knives for, anyhow, if it wasn't
on the chance of some such game. For two women to
carry six case-knives instead of combs and tooth-brushes
is very suspicious in itself, I think."</p>

<p>"But, they weren't carrying them," said Mrs. O'Neil.
"Jack thought they had them for opening windows, but
to think of them staying here three weeks and no baggage.
It makes me wild."</p>

<p>"Well, you and Mr. O'Neil are easy," said Mrs. Ray;
"you're very mooney, both of you. You can't deny
that, Nellie,&mdash;you and your husband haven't got real
good common sense, or you'd have nailed their windows
on from the outside the day you first mistrusted them."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't be mooney any more, anyhow,"
said Mrs. O'Neil; "the drillers came to-day with two
freight cars of machinery, but Jack had them pay a
week in advance. He says he won't even trust the
State after this."</p>

<p>"I don't trust the United States any further than I
can see 'em," said Mrs. Ray; "but this has been a good
lesson for you, Nellie. You won't be letting any sharper
that comes along wear your gran'mother's Paisley shawl
while he spies out the road he's going to skip out over
next, again."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I won't," said Mrs. O'Neil feelingly.</p>

<p>"Sammy Adams was in to spend the afternoon,"
Mrs. Ray went on. "We talked the question of my
marrying him all over again. He always asks me when
he comes for the whole afternoon like that, and he
had such a hard time getting it all out to-day with
people running in to talk about the Lathbuns every
second, that I just had to appreciate the way he stuck
to it clear through to the end."<span class="pagenum">[279]</span></p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"I didn't say much. I was too busy talking to the
others, you know. Yes, indeed. But I was sorry for
him. He's <i>so</i> scared sleeping alone in his house for fear
of maybe being swindled in his bed before he knows it.
And now he's worried for fear the dam is going to
drown him unexpectedly, too. They say if that dam is
built and does bu'st, the Johnstown Flood won't be in
it with Rochester. The folks that want the Falls saved
'll get their chance to say, 'I told you so' then; but
that won't help Sammy much."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" Mrs. O'Neil asked
again.</p>

<p>"Well, when I got a chance, I told him I'd despise
a man who'd let me keep on working as hard as I work
now, but that if any man was to ask me to give up the
church, or the post-office, or my chickens, that would
show he didn't know me, right in the start."</p>

<p>"What did he say to that?" Mrs. O'Neil asked with
interest.</p>

<p>"He didn't know what to say at first, but then he's
the kind of man that never does know what to say. I
declare, Nellie, I do think men that want to marry
women act too foolish for words. Yes, indeed. If
a man wants to do anything else in the world he gets
to work and does it; but if he wants to marry a woman
he just sits still and looks silly and leaves it to the
woman to be done or not."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"Think so," said Mrs. Ray; "I know so. I've had
men acting foolish around where I was all my life.
I've tripped over 'em while sweeping, cooking, washing,
tending Mr. Ray's family by his second wife, sorting<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
mail,&mdash;why, I've had men thinking what a good
wife I'd make all my life, and looking so like idiots
while they thought it that I wouldn't look at it like
they did for any money. They stop by the fence when
I'm ploughing, and just grin with thinking what a
hired man I'd make. I was cleaning the long aisle
carpet at the church last Wednesday, and that minister
that's visiting our minister couldn't keep away from the
window. When I take my eggs and chickens to market,
the buyer down there looks at how I've got those eggs
packed and pinches my chickens, and then he turns
to me and goodness, but his glance is loving."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a very smart woman, you know,"
said Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"I know that; I know it just as well as you do.
But I'm a woman, and I'd like to meet one man as was
a man. I know men pretty well; I knew Mr. Ray
better than he knew himself. Mr. Ray thought he
was doing me an honor to marry me, and I knew he
wasn't, and I lived with him fifteen years and never threw
it in his face once. I let him talk about his ancestors
and I never talked about mine. He thought I didn't
have any; he never realized I kept still so as to keep
from telling such stories as he did. His ancestors! I'd
like to know what sort of ancestors he had! If he'd
had any ancestors, he'd have been bound to be descended
from them, I should think, in which case he wouldn't
have been a Ray. The fact that he and his father called
themselves Jared and spelt it Jarrod was enough for
me; but to make a long story short I'm going to marry
Sammy Adams, and I ran down to tell you that at the
same time that I brought the letter."</p>

<p>There was an outbreak of exclamations and then a<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
beginning at congratulations, but Mrs. Ray stopped
those.</p>

<p>"I don't want congratulations," she said; "there
isn't anything to congratulate me about, for I never
tried to get him, so I haven't had a success or anything
to be proud of. It's just that the dam is so likely to
be going to drown him out that he wants to rent my
second floor and pay the rent every first Monday in
the month. I'm going to go straight on with my life,
and continue to save my own money to finish educating
Mr. Ray's children by his second wife. We shall go
to church together, and he'll sit with me evenings
when I ain't too tired, or when he's nervous over case-knives
and swindling. He's going to pay me for all his
tailoring and all his hair-cuts, but he's to say when he
thinks he needs anything new or it's getting too long.
He'll buy our potatoes and chickens of me at the regular
price, but I'll furnish my own eggs, like I always have."</p>

<p>"It's settled, then?" said Mrs. O'Neil, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's settled. I don't believe the dam will ever
be dug, but I'll marry Sammy all the same."</p>

<p>"You're right about the dam, Mrs. Ray," Alva said,
speaking for the first time. "I don't believe it will
ever be built, either; the Falls have too many friends.
Besides, there must come a time when the God of All
will say to our American Mammon, 'So far and no
further shalt thou go,' and I believe the time is now and
that the place is here."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about all that," said Mrs.
Ray; "but Josiah Bates drove the surveyors home
yesterday, and he gathered from them that if they built
that dam and made that lake, the lake was pretty sure<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
to burst out around back of the Wiley place&mdash;that
low place you know&mdash;and we'd have a new waterfall
in through the Wiley cow-pasture, even if we didn't
have nothing worse."</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" cried Mrs. O'Neil, "what would
the Wileys say to that!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what the Wileys would say to that,"
said Mrs. Ray; "but it made me know what I'd say to
Sammy. Yes, indeed. If there isn't going to be any
dam, the summers here are going to go on exactly as
they used to, and I've got to have a man to bring up
my ice! You know my motto, 'He moves in a mysterious
way,' and I can see now why the Lathbuns
and the dam both come. I had a dreadful time last
summer getting my ice up, and as long as everybody's
been betting all along that I'd always marry Sammy
some day, I might as well do it now as any time. Yes,
indeed."</p>

<p>"You are very sensible," said Alva, rising, "and I'm
sure that you will be very happy. I congratulate you."
She held out her hand. "Good-bye."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you're going so soon," said Mrs. Ray,
clasping it warmly, "you've meant such a lot of cancellation,
and then I've got very fond of you, too."</p>

<p>Alva smiled. "I'm only going out on the bridge
just now for a little," she said, turning to Mrs. O'Neil.
"I'll be back shortly."</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Neil glanced towards the window. "It's
snowing harder and harder," she said; "wrap up
warm."</p>

<p>Alva went quietly out. When they were alone, Mrs.
Ray shook her head. "She looks bad," she said; "I'm
not sure that she didn't care for him, after all. She's<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
got that mooney look. I know just the look. I'd have
looked just that way by spring, if I'd taken Gran'ma
Benton and the parrot. I'm glad I've decided to marry
Sammy, instead."</p>

<p>"You won't take them, then?" asked Mrs. O'Neil.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't stand Sammy and a parrot at once,
and then, too, he might quarrel with the parrot, or
Gran'ma Benton might make trouble between Sammy
and me. I never allowed any one to make trouble
between Mr. Ray and me, and I won't allow trouble
this time, either. If I'm going to be unhappy married,
I won't marry. That's flat."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Jack knows they're arrested!" said
Mrs. O'Neil, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I stopped in the bar on purpose," said Mrs. Ray,
"I thought he ought to know right away."</p>

<p>"Was he there?" asked the wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mrs. Ray, calmly, "but I did what I
could, Nellie, and nobody can be expected to pass <i>that</i>,
you know."<span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BREAKING OF ANOTHER DAY AND WAY</p>

<p>Alva slipped into her cape, and drawing some fur
up round her throat, set swiftly forth upon the
Long Bridge&mdash;for the last time, she told herself.</p>

<p>The snow was falling fast, but not thickly as yet,
and she had it in her heart to steal under cover of
the fast-approaching twilight to her house, and look
upon that also for the last time. Her sorrow was too
deep to leave any room to mourn the background of
her dream, but the background was consecrated by the
dream and she longed to stand once more close to
those walls, even if only to sob her heart out alone
under the rustle of dead leaves, amidst the fast deepening
snow.</p>

<p>There was in her that awful strength that saves
one's reason in the first shock of the otherwise unbearable.
Years were ahead and yet her heart did not
shrink; endless gray duties stretched between their
mile-stones, but to her it mattered not. Nothing
mattered, she told herself over and over. Life would
go on, other lives in especial would go on; their demands
would be hers to meet, their cares and troubles, their
joys and sorrows would be hers to reflect, but to her
personally nothing would&mdash;nothing could&mdash;matter
more. Her unseeing eyes looked out over the gorge;<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
the matchless beauty, for the preservation of which her
dead love had fought so hard, came to a blind market
now; she could not see, she could not feel, for her life
and all that makes life worth living was over.</p>

<p>So she swept on, her dark cape fluttering wide like
wings on either side of her steady swiftness. The snow
crystals clung to the wool and quickly starred its night
with stars, but she saw no night except her own, and
noted no stars. "And yet I must not give way too
much," she thought suddenly, with a quick stabbing
sense of proving unworthy; "if I am what I have told
Lassie that one should be&mdash;if I am what one who has
truly loved should surely be&mdash;I shall be strong and live
resolutely as he lived, even though I have been so
crushed. Pain could not crush his spirit; shall sorrow
crush mine? I <i>will</i> be strong."</p>

<p>The letter which she had brought out with her came
to her mind then, and she paused and read it. It was
from the surgeon and told her what she had lately
mistrusted,&mdash;that there had never been the slightest
chance of moving him, that she had been sent away as
a child is banished from a painful scene, and that
she had been beguiled as a child is beguiled. She did
not resent the truth, she was too big to resent such a
truth; but she felt freshly mournful, and the home that
was to have been seemed to fade utterly out of her
consciousness, leaving her with no desire to ever see it
again.</p>

<p>But there was another sheet within the envelope.
She took that out, too. It was printed&mdash;in a hand
that trembled. Her heart contracted as she saw
the crooked lines,&mdash;so much ran deep between
them.<span class="pagenum">[286]</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Alva</span>:&mdash;I have struggled. I shall not give up.
I believe sometimes God has given a new body to
serve a needed end. I cannot go. I must come back.
Not for your sake. But for theirs&mdash;for the sake
of those who will never know. If I come, help me
again. For you and for me help is the only bond. I
am not sure that there is any other that endures. Not
in this present world of ours.</p></blockquote>

<p>She shook a little. Something especially cold and
piercing struck to her heart. She raised her eyes
quickly, and there, close beside her on the bridge, the
dead man stood.</p>

<p>His bright dark eyes looked straight into hers.</p>

<p>"Don't you know who I am?" he said.</p>

<p>She would have fallen but for his quick grasp, and
the grasp choked the cry that was rising, for it was the
grasp of flesh and of strength.</p>

<p>"Don't you know who I am?" he asked again. "I
thought that I saw in your eyes that you knew. I
thought that she had described me to you. I'm Lisle
Bayard. You wrote to me, you know."</p>

<p>She drew away from him, and leaned heavily against
the bridge-rail. If it were true that this were he! A
new body to serve a great purpose. If that Mystery
that is the rooting of all that is or is to be had been
building this man and this hour, and weaving and twisting
and shaping both to its ends! She seemed to stand
motionless, but within herself she was dizzy and
reeling. "He moves in a mysterious way, His wonders
to perform."</p>

<p>"You have freed them?" she said, divining truth
with a prescience that startled herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "I have been to Geneseo. They<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
are free. But you never really believed that I had any
interest in them, did you?"</p>

<p>His voice was no strange voice in her ears, nor was
his manner that of a stranger. She had to press her
temples hard with her two hands. "You are like the
man whom I loved," she said; "he&mdash;he died yesterday.
That was what drew me to her; she described
you and said that you loved her."</p>

<p>"Poor thing," he said, simply.</p>

<p>"And that you pursued her," Alva went on; "you
can think that I befriended her then. I tried to help
her. Because I, too, loved&mdash;and hoped."</p>

<p>"It was good of you," he said; "but they are
mere adventuresses&mdash;not worth your troubling."</p>

<p>"But you have helped them?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, yes. But," he hesitated; "I am tired
of my life," he added suddenly. "I've turned over a
new leaf&mdash;I've reformed."</p>

<p>"Since when?"</p>

<p>"Since yesterday."</p>

<p>She held hard to the bridge-rail. "Since yesterday,"
she repeated; "since yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, since yesterday."</p>

<p>Her eyes were staring into his now. "Tell me
about it?" she cried, as the starving cry out for food&mdash;"at
once."</p>

<p>"I don't know about it. I just turned in disgust
from myself. It was all in a minute. I wandered about
all day and all last night. I tried to drink&mdash;you know
I drink?&mdash;and then all of a sudden I realized what a
beast I'd been, and I turned from it all. Something
stronger than myself drew me to Geneseo this morning;
something stronger yet drew me here; what led me out<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
upon the bridge was strongest of all. I don't know
what it all means, but perhaps you do."</p>

<p>For a long minute she looked at him, and then she
spoke. "The man who died is guiding you," she said;
"I know it is that."</p>

<p>He smiled a little. "Can I trust him?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I think so," she answered; "because his appeal is
to your better self. You will learn."</p>

<p>"And you will teach me?" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"You will teach me?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"I am going home," she said. "I live far from here.
I have duties which will chain me there for life. You
will learn of him alone. You will be guided; do not
fear."</p>

<p>He looked at her, and his eyes blazed suddenly.
She shrank back with a cry. "Oh, no&mdash;not that&mdash;not
that!"
she exclaimed; "I loved him and he is
dead. His work descends on us to do, that is all.
All!"</p>

<p>The man, looking down at her with the dead man's
eyes, was silent.</p>

<p>"I am not able to talk to you," she said, "I can
hardly control my voice. He died yesterday, and to-day
you speak to me with his voice. And it is so strange,&mdash;your
coming. It is all so strange."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is all strange," he said; "but it cannot
stop here, you know. The Purpose that has brought
this about will not cease to exist now."</p>

<p>She felt herself agitated, unnerved, trembling. She
took hold of the bridge-rail again. "The Purpose
works for great ends," she said; "we must learn that.<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
I have learned it. Even a little respite from daily
life is not allowed, when one has once crossed the
border and left self behind. I have had to learn that
in a bitter school. For God's sake, lift burdens; do
not add to them. And do not make my lot harder
than it is to be. You are not him, and I know it. Do
not seek friendship with me; it is torture."</p>

<p>"But if I were he," he said, "if I do his work, live
towards his goal, accomplish his purposes. Who shall
say what soul I bear? I never had a soul till yesterday.
I have one now. Where did it come from, this new soul
of mine. Perhaps from him. I've read stories like
that."</p>

<p>"I cannot bear it," she said, suddenly; "my head
refuses to understand. All that I have believed is
rolling and crashing around me. Let us say good-by.
In a few hours I shall be far away. Oh, I shall be
glad&mdash;so glad&mdash;to go."</p>

<p>"But I shall remain," he declared. "I shall take
up the battle, and I shall win his unfinished fight.
Let us leave the future wrapped in its mystery. I
have been impatient all my life, but now I can wait."</p>

<p>She walked away through the snow.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, as she moved, she felt her steps
stayed&mdash;she stopped. It was not the man who had
stayed her; he was standing where she had left him,
behind her&mdash;there on the bridge. But she was stopped
by a thought; at that thought she turned.</p>

<p>"If you are to live here," she said faltering, her
voice quite unlike its usual firm, low purpose,&mdash;"if
you are to live here, you will want a home. There is
a house&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused. Her hand had drawn a key from her<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
pocket, and without further explanation she held it out
to him.</p>

<p>He approached and took the key. He asked no question.
He spoke no word. They did not even exchange
a glance.</p>

<p>Five minutes later a veil of snowflakes divided them,
and the gorge lay black between.</p>

<p>What is there to be said further? Nothing unless
perhaps the single line that can so fitly begin and end
all:</p>

<p>"He moves in a mysterious way."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
